TU The TU benchmark contains both English and Dutch textual evidence. We have experimented with different parameter values for the LSH methods and picked the ones that give best performance . This    , in turn    , corresponds to computing the negative logprobability of the true class. Our techniques highlight the importance of low-level computer vision features and demonstrate the power of certain semantic features extracted using deep learning. Several interviewees reported that " operationalization " of their predictive models—building new software features based on the predictive models is extremely important for demonstrating the value of their work. Another 216 words returned the same results for the three semantic relevance approaches. To simplify our experiments    , we dropped the document segments that were in the gold standard but were not in the ranked list of selected retrieved segments although we could have kept them by folding them into the LSA spaces. Evaluation
To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation. , SVA and CR    , and SVA 2 and CR 2     , respectively. The evaluation results are given in 
Result II. While LIB and LIB+LIF did well in terms of rand index    , LIF and LIB*TF were competitive in recall. After enough information about previously-executed    , empty-result queries has been accumulated in C aqp     , our method can often successfully detect empty-result queries and avoid the expensive query execution. All 24 out of 24 QALD-4 queries    , with all there syntactic variations    , were correctly fitted in NQS    , giving a high sensitivity to structural variation. The correlation between Qrels-based measures and Trelsbased measures is extremely high. These lexicons along with example posts for each narrative are shown in

The two are related quantities with different focuses. All the triples including the owl:sameAs statements are distributed over 20 SPARQL endpoints which are deployed on 10 remote virtual machines having 2GB memory each.

We trained the CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder model on 3 million randomly selected English-language tweets populated using data augmentation techniques    , which are useful for controlling generalization error for deep learning models . For example    , if the query is " night "     , relevant pictograms are first selected using the highest semantic relevance value in each pictogram    , and once candidate pictograms are selected    , the pictograms are then ranked according to the semantic relevance value of the query's major category    , which in this case is the TIME category. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 2.1 Interface
These experiments were conducted as part of our participation in the TREC 2007 ciQA task. Although the experiment included only six topics    , which made it feasible to increase the number of test subjects    , fruitful data was collected on the characteristics of topics. Sparck Jones and Van Rijsbergen Sparck Jones 76/ suggest that the ideal collection should: q be large    , i.e. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments. Our approach called SemanticTyper is significantly different from approaches in past work in that we attempt to capture the distribution and hence characteristic properties of the data corresponding to a semantic label as a whole rather than extracting features from individual data values. This procedure resembles the one used in 
Fitting the Model Parameters Θ
This step fixes the epoch segmentation Λ and adopts stochastic gradient ascent to optimize the regularized log-likelihood in Eq. Since we analyzed document similarity based on weighted word frequency    , it was important that non-English documents be removed    , since we used an English-language corpus to estimate the general frequency of word occurrence. For a value of a property    , the likelihood probability is calculated as P 'value | pref erred based on the frequency count table of that column. , http://searchmsn n.com/results.aspx  ?q=machine+learning&form=QBHP. In early years    , researchers have investigated into task-oriented conversation systems

Conversation Systems
Early work on conversation systems is generally based on rules or templates and is designed for specific domains 
 Unlike previous work    , we conduct a novel study of retrievalbased automatic conversation systems with a deep learning-torespond schema via deep learning paradigm. Further assuming under this condition that the Web application is invulnerable induces a false negative discussed in Section 5 as PF L |V  ,D. If an injection succeeds    , it serves as an example of the IKM learning from experience and eventually producing a valid set of values. Overall Approach
We now present our overall approach called SemanticTyper combining the approaches to textual and numeric data. Whilst this may imply agreement between the searcher and the system    , some aspects of the experimental design may have created a bias towards more documents being saved from the top of the list. The first independent model IND assumes that the relevance of a specific top-ranked passage si is independent of the relevance of any other passage in s. We use the logistic function to model the relevance of a passage. Otherwise    , CyCLaDEs just insert a new entry in the profile. Therefore    , by modeling both types of dependencies we see an additive effect    , rather than an absorbing effect. Leading into TREC 2007 it was empirically determined that the models based on grouping questions by answer types was most effective     , and so was the configuration used for the TREC 2007 test set. Introduction
Various types of user studies can support the design and evaluation of digital libraries. Empirical studies have shown that our new weighting scheme can be incorporated to improve the performance of Pearson Correlation Coefficient method substantially under many different configurations. We compare the weighted memory-based approach by incorporating our weighting scheme to standard memory-based approach including the Pearson Correlation Coefficient PCC method    , the Vector Similarity VS method    , the Aspect Model AM    , and the Personality Diagnosis PD method. Columns two to six capture the number of hierarchy levels    , product classes    , properties    , value instances    , and top-level classes for each product ontology. For QALD-4 dataset    , it was observed that 21 out of 24 queries with their variations were correctly fitted in NQS. Results: Overall Approach
First    , we used the data extracted from DBpedia consisting of the 52 numeric & textual data properties of the City class to test our proposed overall approach SemanticTyper. Image relevance was also considered to be a factor for this experiment. Note that the variance is inversely proportional to the number of ratings so as the number of ratings increases the model becomes increasingly more certain in the preferences decreasing the variance. LIB+LIF: To weight a term    , we simply add LIB and LIF together by treating them as two separate pieces of information. If the same types of dependencies were capture by both syntactic and semantic dependencies    , LCE would be expected to perform about equally as well as relevance models. – We evaluate our approach by extending LDF client with CyCLaDEs. This list is used by the predictor to perform a breadth first search of the possible concepts representing the input text. We compare the highest value with the cutoff value to determine whether the pictogram is relevant or not. In general    , we propose to maximize the following normalized likelihood function with a relative weight c~    , 
 N~N6w K log k N~ 6' K  + N.zXlog 4     , e     , 4 
with respect to all parameters   ,I   ,    , ~    , r. The normalization ensures that each document gets the same weight irrespective of its length; 0 < c~ < 1 has to be specified a priori. Given the synthesized schemas    , we created a database for each alternative . Each perturbation vector is directly applied to the hash values of the query object    , thus avoiding the overhead of point perturbation and hash value computations associated with the entropy-based LSH method. A single directional LSTM typically propagates information from the first word to the last; hence the hidden state at a certain step is dependent on its previous words only and blind of future words .

When X entirely differentiates fault-prone software parts    , then the curve approximates a step function. IMRank achieves both remarkable efficiency and high accuracy by exploiting the interplay between the calculation of ranking-based marginal influence spread and the ranking of nodes.

Design of the Mixed-Media Collection
The experimental mixed-media collection is based on a partition of the existing mono-media documents collections of electronic text    , spoken data and scanned document images. To compute the similarity weights w i  ,k between users ui and u k     , several similarity measures can be adopted    , e.g. Our method presupposes a set of pictograms having a list of interpretation words and ratios for each pictogram. The following two sections describe our experimental design and results. Our experiments show that the multi-probe LSH method can use ten times fewer number of probes than the entropy-based approach to achieve the same search quality. We design an efficient last-to-first allocating strategy to approximately estimate the ranking-based marginal influence spread of nodes for a given ranking    , further improving the efficiency of IMRank. Automatic evaluation of tag suggestion engines is also critical to building effective systems. The two functions will be used to evaluate both our GPbased approach and the baseline method in our experiments. The encoder consists of convolutional layers to extract features from the characters and an LSTM layer to encode the sequence of features to a vector representation    , while the decoder consists of two LSTM layers which predict the character at each time step from the output of encoder. The user interface is then established by performing experimental evaluations.

OUR APPROACH: OVERVIEW
Our approach of using translation representation for a monolingual retrieval task is summarized in 
CONSTRUCTION OF TRANSLATION REPRESENTATION
Expected Frequency of an Auxiliary Word
In this paper    , source language refers to the language of a given document collection    , and auxiliary language refers to an additional language used as the translation representation . In the future we plan to apply deep learning approach to other IR applications    , e.g. The entropy-based LSH method is likely to probe previously visited buckets    , whereas the multi-probe LSH method always visits new buckets. This means in practice that a person uses approximately a day to finalize the work. Our initial examination revealed that the allocated users IDs are very evenly distributed across the ID space. Overall    , LIB*LIF had a strong performance across the data collections. Demand for Experimentation. Considerations other than pure utility values such as income and fairness might need to be taken into account. Collective Similarity

Each element function fcw is a negative log-likelihood function with the 2 norm for composition c    , which is a single element of set C. 
Optimization
There are a few issues with optimizing the composite objectives in 3.6. This step is like dividing the problem of learning one single ranking model for all training queries into a set of sub-problems of learning the ranking model for each ranking-sensitive query topic. Availability of both words and n-grams also helped us significantly in the cross-language task    , for which HAIRCUT was a first-time participant. , models are built and applied on the same project    , our spectral classifier ranks in the second tier    , while only random forest ranks in the first tier. There are many different schemes for choosing Δλ. The model can be directly used to derive quantitative predictions about term and link occurrences. In most experiments    , the proposed methods    , especially LIB*LIF fusion     , significantly outperformed TF*IDF in terms of several evaluation metrics. Currently    , there are a number of commercial products available for individual communities to create their specialized digital library for example    , http://www.software.ibm.com/is/dig- lib/v2factsheet. We used a mixed method approach to develop a thorough picture of existing practices around social learning and the impact of So.cl. RQ3 considers a second aspect of topic    , whether the topic is visually or semantically oriented 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN 2.1 Design
In our experiment we manipulated four independent variables: image size small    , medium    , large    , relevance level relevant    , not relevant    , topic difficulty easy    , medium    , difficult    , very difficult and topic visuality visual    , medium    , semantic. The most difficult aspect in experimental design was deciding how to choose the query pairs. Therefore    , we extracted entities from the topic description and the top related tweets by means of different NER services DBpedia Spotlight    , Alchemy API    , and Zemanta. We employ a deep learning engine to semantically label photos to explore the visual content of real-life photos. Moreover in 28% of searches documents were saved only from the top 25. Our empirical study with documents from ImageCLEF has shown that this approach is more effective than the translation-based approach that directly applies the online translation system to translate queries. We use a model that separates observed voting data into confounding factors    , such as position and social influence bias    , and article-specific factors. The Combined Model
 The CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder model draws on the intuition that the sequence of features e.g. In addition    , more work was put into developing the method and training RaPiD7 coaches that could independently take the method into use in their projects. Dennis Egan of BelIcore ran these experiments    , with two chemistry pr+ fessors at Cornell serving as consultants to design the questions    , and 1000 articles from the Jounzal of the American Chemical Society used for data. Our results indicate that 2GB memory will be able to hold a multi-probe LSH index for 60 million image data objects    , since the multiprobe method is very space efficient. In the future    , we plan to extend our work to the more open setup    , similar to the QALD hybrid task    , where questions no longer have to be answered exclusively from the KB.

Tasks 
Different tasks require different kinds of search strategies    , systems    , and UIs 
METHOD 
 There are tradeoffs between pure experimental betweensubjects  and repeated measure within-subject user studies. To this end    , we specify a distribution over Q: PQq can indicate    , for example    , the probability that a specific query q is issued to the information retrieval system which can be approximated. Finally    , the unnormalized importance weight for particle f     , ω f after td is updated as
ω f ← ω f P xtd|z f td     , s f td     , x1:t−1    , 
7 
 which has the intuitive explanation that the weight for particle f is updated by multiplying in the marginal probability of the new observation xtd    , which we compute from the last 10 samples of the MCMC sweep over a given document. We measure its value as the Shannon entropy of a location: 
Hl = − ï¿¿ u∈N h S l p l u logp l u 4 
where p l u is the probability that a given check-in in place l is made by user u. If the friendship measure is larger than the threshold    , the friend ID with its rating information is sent back to the target peer. Therefore    , we need to deal with potentially infinite number of related learning problems    , each for one of the query q ∈ Q. We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models. Note    , partial bindings    , which come from the same input    , have the same set of unevaluated triple patterns. One is a variant of the Bellcore SuperBook system

This year we approached TREC Genomics using a cross language IR CLIR techniques. Furthermore    , RaPiD7 is characterized by the starting point of its development; problems realizing in inspections. The subjective effort results also indicate that visual topics require less effort to judge in terms of subjective effort    , for example it was found that participants believed they had better performance for visual topics    , while for semantic topics    , the perceived mental workload and effort was greater. Without the efforts of these users we would not have such good results nor would we have RaPiD7 as an institutionalized way of working. Dijkstra 1969 EWD-249    , derived in a systematic way. Language modeling
The retrieval engine used for the Ad Hoc task is based on generative language models and uses cross-entropy between query and document models as main scoring criterion. Previous work on the relationship between topic familiarity and search behavior has established that when users are more familiar with a topic    , they spend less time on search tasks    , and are likely to find a higher number of relevant documents as a proportion of documents viewed 
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
To investigate the impact of topic familiarity on search behavior    , we carried out a user study. To combat this problem    , we propose a Last-to-First Allocating LFA strategy to efficiently estimate Mr    , leveraging the intrinsic interdependence between ranking and ranking-based marginal influence spread. The default probing method for multi-probe LSH is querydirected probing. Pearson's correlation r ∈ 
Individualism vs. Collectivism 
In addition to pace of life    , also human relationships differ across cultures. To determine if a profile is better than another one    , we use the generalized Jaccard similarity coefficient defined as: 
Jx    , y = i minx i     , y i  i maxx i     , y i  
where x and y are two multi-sets and the natural numbers x i ≥ 0 and y i ≥ 0 are the multiplicity of item i in each multiset. The particulars of how this assignment procedure works is the experimental design    , and it can substantially affect the precision with which we can estimate δ. These parameters can be determined by maximizing the log-likelihood function i.e. Initialization. The most popular choices for pooling operation are: max and average pooling. Experimental Conditions
 We refined our basic survey idea into a 2 x 4 betweensubjects design. Following the likelihood principle    , one determines P d    , P zjd    , and P wjz b y maximization of the logglikelihood function 
L = X d2D X w2W nd; w log P d; w ; 3 
where nd; w denotes the term frequency    , i.e. Image tagging aims to automatically assign concepts to images and has been studied intensively in the past decade    , while transfer deep learning has drawn a great deal of attention recently with the success of deep learning techniques. Out of these posts    , 1.9M posts are tagged with an average of 1.75 tags per post. Although the methods resemble each other in many ways    , the differences are evident. We want to semantify text by assigning word sense IDs to the content words in the document. All the classifiers are implemented with random forest classification model    , which was reported as the best classification model in CCR. We measure mainly the hit-ratio; the fraction of queries answered by the decentralized cache. Ultimately we used 92 bilingual aspects from 33 topics    , including 3 Chinese aspects that could only be used as training data for English aspect classification because each of them had only 4 segments. This is done using stochastic gradient descent. The correlation between the two measures was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient and Kendall's−τ 4 . Finally    , we reiterated the importance of choosing expansion terms that model relevance    , rather than the relevant documents and showed how LCE captures both syntactic and query-side semantic dependencies. In light of TF*IDF    , we reason that combining the two will potentiate each quantity's strength for term weighting. In order to improve the quality of opinion extraction results    , we extracted the title and content of the blog post for indexing because the scoring functions and Lucene indexing engine cannot differentiate between text present in the links and sidebars of the blog post. Central to this strategy was the development of a superior professional workstation    , subsequently named Star    , that was to provide a major step forward in several different domains of office automation. The noise in the content may create errors while doing document retrieval thus drastically reducing the precision of retrieval. The play is divided into acts in such a way that each act has a fixed set of actors participating objects fitting conveniently on the scene scenario diagram. Most steps just move the point of the simplex where the objective value is largest highest point to a lower point with the smaller objective value. Finally     , if the effective number of particles �ωt� −2 2 falls below a threshold we stochastically replicate each particle based on its normalized weight. With a simple and fast heuristic we determine the language of the document: we assume the document to be in the language in which it contains the most stopwords. The advantage of the vector space computation is that it is simpler and faster. The dataset sizes are chosen such that the index data structure of the basic LSH method can entirely fit into the main memory. The latter problem is trivial    , as users tend to have very few pinboards per category 
Category prediction
We design a multi-class Random Forest classifier 7 to learn which category a user will repin a given image into. Capturing LCC Structure: To capture the connectivity structure of the Largest Connected Component LCC    , we use a few high-degree users as starting seeds and crawl the structure using a breadth-first search BFS strategy. We found that the notion of 'alignment' used by the teachers was both qualitatively and quantitatively different when they were searching for aligned curriculum themselves vs. judging alignment suggestions identified by others. We are also exploring novel way of presenting the suggestion list    , besides using plain text. Here a candidate path is a path from vs or vt to an intermediate vertex that follows the appropriate pattern. , projection    , duplicate elimination that have no influence on the emptiness of the query output. h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h APPROACH QUERY DOCTOR BOOK CRY PLAYGROUND BEDTIME 
Conclusion
 Pictograms used in a pictogram email system are created by novices at pictogram design    , and they do not have single    , clear semantics. Next    , we used Alchemy 2 to generatively learn the weights of our base MLN using the evidence data. Finally    , we need a ranking function that assigns scores to the datasets in CCDD S  with respect to D S expressing the likelihood of a dataset in CCDD S  to contain identical instances with those of D S . In all experiments on the four benchmark collections    , top mance scores were achieved among the proposed methods. We use this method in our prediction experiments on heldout data in the Experiments section. We will design a sequence of perturbation vectors such that each vector in this sequence maps to a unique set of hash values so that we never probe a hash bucket more than once. Finally    , we adopt the weighted combination of the m kernels: 
κ = m l=1 α l κ l for KLSH. We prove that IMRank    , starting from any initial ranking     , definitely converges to a self-consistent ranking in a finite number of steps. Besides its advantages in learning efficiency and accuracy    , our approach has one other important benefit specific to the Web. Given that our system is trained off this data    , we believe we can drastically improve the performance of our system by identifying the blog posts have been effectively tagged    , meaning that the tags associated with the post are likely to be considered relevant by other users. We would extract those facts as a whole    , noting that they might appear more than once in the abstract    , and then take both fact and term frequency into consideration when ranking the abstracts for relevance. We wanted to see if a the fourth approach    , the categorized and weighted approach    , performed better than the rest; b the semantic relevance approach in general was better than the simple query match approach; c the categorized approach in general was better than the not-categorized approach. There were a total of 106 bilingual aspects from 36 topics that met this requirement excluding the All Others categories. Using these constraints    , we calculate the model parameters Θ with maximizing the log-likelihood log L in Equation 9. Noting that our work provides a framework which can be fit for any personalized ranking method    , we plan to generalize it to other pairwise methods in the future. Accordingly    , objects {g    , h    , i    , j    , k    , l    , m} are grouped into the second cluster . Section 3 reports the experimental results of several well-known ontology systems on the UOBM and provides detailed discussions. We then present four simple experimental designs that cover a range of benchmarking setups    , including " live " benchmarks and carefully controlled experiments    , and derive their standard errors. In our implementation    , we sample users uniformly to optimize the average AUC metric to be discussed later. However    , we recognize the limitations of the trade-offs we made in our study design     , including the small sample size and lack of experimental control. The existing thread has the additional topic node 413 which is about compression of inverted index for fast information retrieval. Yet another complicating dimension    , which is nevertheless critical to scale large testing systems    , is distributed benchmarking across multiple hosts. Hence we restrict our attention to perturbation vectors ∆ with δi ∈ {−1    , 0    , 1}. Term-Weighting Components
