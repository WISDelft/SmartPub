Some statistics regarding the road maps con­ structed for the protein folding problems are shown in Ta­ hIe 2. We also show results that demonstrate the advantages of our approach over support vector machine based models. In this paper a set of operator models .was generated. The partial derivates of the scoring function  , with respect to λ and μ  , are computed as follows: Note that we rank according to the log query likelihood in order to simplify the mathematical derivations. Overlapping data points occur frequently in 2-D plots and identifying each individual data point and its coordinates is a difficult task. maximum expected likelihood is indeed the true matching σI . The physical parameters corresponding to this transfer function are shown in Table I. One would need more data  , especially of control subjects to be able to state that automatic methods always significantly outperform human observers in clinical practice. Figure 11shows the analytical and experimental values of G for t w o orthogonal directions. Two set of queries are used to perform two tasks: building a type summary and calculating some bibliometrics-based summary. Predictability " is approximated by the predictive power of a support vector machine. Furthermore  , the XSLT function library  , which is part of SCX  , allows for convenient navigation of the relationships between schema component  , for example traversal of the type hierarchy. However   , this strategy is only applicable when 3D models of the objects are available and the curvature of the objects is relatively small. Let the values of at the end of the lift-off and transfer forward subphases be +L It'is a function of the kinematic cycle phase variable  , +  , which is used to implement periodic gaits 1 ,4 ,10. We would expect that in the first case  , the learned model would look very similar to baseline query likelihood efficient but not effective. In that work  , a deformable template method is used to optimize a likelihood function based on the proposed model. Using a support vector machine with normalized quadratic kernel and an all-pairs method  , this yields an accuracy of 67.9%. the white LED used in the lamp were manually soldered to the composite prior to folding. The mutual exclusion relation is simply the diagonal set of Σ 0 × Σ 0   , meaning that different events in Σ 0 could fire simultaneously. Since it is desired that none of the joints overshoot the commanded position or the response be critically damped  , In the absence of any feedforward terms  , the response is governed by the poles of the transfer function. We require that the transfer of commodities from the virtual source node to each node in V is instantaneous. However  , when positional information is added the inverted file entries for common words become dramatically larger. Note that a function T with the threshold property does not necessarily provide an ordering of pages based on their likelihood of being good. Results. The important point to notice is that the predictive variance captures the inherent uncertainty in the function  , with tight error bars in regions of observed data  , and with growing error bars away from observed data. Other important questions in this context that need to be explored are: How to choose classes ? The form of SA used is a variation of the Nelder-Mead downhill simplex method  , which incorporates a random variable to overcome local minima 9. In this simulation  , folding of the cloth by the inertial force is not considered. Fold " flattens " tables by converting one row into multiple rows  , folding a set of columns together into one column and replicating the rest. 6 Combined Query Likelihood Model with Submodular Function: re-rank retrieved questions by combined query likelihood model system 2 using submodular function.  Model selection criteria usually assumes that the global optimal solution of the log-likelihood function can be obtained. Folding: Classes of data are folded in the case of symbolic testing. A detailed discussion can be found in If the load is negligible the actuator dynamics transfer function becomes A brief discussion on EH servo system operation modeling is iven. In each set of experiments presented here  , best scores in each metric are highlighted in bold whereas italic values are those better than TF*IDF baseline scores. Due to space constraints  , the examples in this paper focus around the reliability requirement  , defined as the likelihood of loss of aircraft function or critical failure is required to be less than 10 -9 per flight hour 10 . The log-likelihood function of Gumbel based on random sample x1  , x2  , . In our case  , the closed position loop transfer function of one motor is approximated by a first order system : Winding motors can have a very small response time  , but in the general case  , the motor position control loop cannot be neglected in the full open loop transfer function of one mode. Therefore  , to evaluate the performance of ranking  , we use the standard information retrieval measures. Thus  , accurate current-based output models are difficult to develop  , and more importantly  , to invert for torque control schema. Thus  , by Definition 1  , the relative degree of the input-output transfer function is two  , regardless of how many modes are included. 20  , the transfer function from the disturbance to the output force is expressed as follows: Then  , from eq. Research interests in this problem have been further fueled by the insight that the robot motion planning problem shares much similarity with and can serve as a model of diverse physical geometry problems such as mechanical system disassembly  , computer animation  , protein folding  , ligand docking and surgery planning. A finite supply of electrodes resulted in a relatively sparse set of data 87 samples and offers two distinct ways to analyze the data. Borrowing from past studies on demographic inference   , three types of features were used for distinguishing between account types: 1 post content features  , 2 stylistic features  , how the information is presented  , and 3 structural and behavioral features based on how the account interacts with others. Folding of the cloth by the inertial force is not analyzed in this paper. that is simply an integrator  , Along the trajectories of Euler's equation in Choosing a first order stable transfer function leads to a compensator E. We selected a 3rd- order Go so that the output of the controller is continuous. 20 is diagonal  , the repetitive controller for each axis can be designed independently . We derive a transfer function for the pulling feeder for convex polygonal parts  , i.e. The whole system consists of three major compo­ nents  , namely texture feature extractor  , texture clas­ sifier and boundary detector. Consequently  , an action in the state-based model will correspond to multiple concrete-class events in the traces. Indeed  , it can be argued that the P R M framework was instrumental in this broadening of the range of applicability of motion planning  , as many of these problems had never before been considered candidates for automatic methods. This paper is focused on estimating the joint stiffness which is the major source of flexibility in many applications . 12  , the dynamic folding is shown as a continuous sequence of pictures taken at intervals of 57 ms. V. EXPERIMENT In Fig. Table 4Table 4  , the SDM-CA and MLM-CA baselines optimized SDM and MLM both outperform previously proposed models on the entire query set  , most significantly on QALD-2 and ListSearch query sets. While an ideal cut would result in the same roughness on both sides  , occurrences of bunching  , folding  , tearing  , and debris generation can result in complementary edges with very different cut qualities. In QALD-3 a multilingual task has been introduced  , and since QALD-4 the hybrid task is included.  Query term distribution and term dependence are two similar features that rely on the difference of the query term distributions between the the homepage collection and the content-page collection. We show that  , unfortunately  , there exist non-convex polygonal parts that despite asymmetry cannot be fed using inside-out pull actions. We follow the typical generative model in Information Retrieval that estimates the likelihood of generating a document given a query  , pd|q. In this section  , we address the control problem of active vibration canceling of CDPR with light and flexible wires in the modal space. Figure 7 shows the arrangement of the singlemass arm. However  , on QALD-2  , whose queries are questions such as 'Who created Wikipedia'  , simple text similarity features are not as strong. The uncertainty is estimated for localization using a local map by fitting a normal distribution to the likelihood function generated. The BSBM benchmark 5  focuses on the e-commerce domain and provides a data generation tool and a set of twelve SPARQL queries together with their corresponding SQL queries generated by hand. Typical full-text indexing e.g. We cannot derive a closed-form solution for the above optimization problem. The code generator or translator produces a sequence of function calls in Adept's robot programming language  , V+  , that implement the given plan in our workcell. We used an opinionated lexicon consisting of 389 words  , which is a subset complied from the MPQA subjective lexicon 11. The system then displays information pertaining to self and others aggregated by these two functions via an information display interface. Configuration similarity simulated annealing CSSA  , based on 215  , performs random walks just like iterative improvement Figure 3Parameter tuning for GCSA but in addition to uphill  , it also accepts downhill moves with a certain probability  , trying to avoid local maxima. Figure 8 shows the predicted response of the subject using the transfer function model defined in 17  , where the measured controlled signal ys of the practised operator and the predicted signal are shown. Learning RFG is to estimate the remaining free parameters θ  , which maximizes the log-likelihood objective function Oθ. Thus  , a deformation that increases the objective function is sometimes generated  , which improves the performance of optimization. Additional folding of implementation details may occur in simulations based executable specifications such as Petri nets or PATSley ZSSS. Attributes that range over a broader set of values e.g. According to this strategy  , fields in records are encoded using feature vectors that are used to train a binary support vector machine classifier. Thus  , the MAP estimate is the maximum of the following likelihood function. On this basis  , we utilize stochastic gradient descent to conduct the unconstrained optimization. Once the SFL system has been nondimensionalized  , a nondimensional controller can be designed to meet the nondimensional performance specifications. Neverthcless  , we show that these additional factors can be dealt with in a reasonable fashion within the PRM framework. The painting mot ,ion was generated by virtually folding out the surfaces to be painted  , putting on the painting motion and folding back the surfaces and letting the painting motions following this folding of surfaces 2  , 81. In this section we describe the details of integrating Simulated Annealing and downhill Simplex method in the optimization framework to minimize the loss function associated directly to NDCG measure. It is difficult to characterize the acceleration of the incremental updates by a multiplicative factor  , as it is clearly a different shape than the standard curves. In some review data sets  , external signals about sentiment polarities are directly available. Future test rigs may allow forward motion  , or may flow water past a stationary system to simulate forward movement of the water runner. A new parameter estimate is then computed by minimizing the objective function given the current values of T s = is the negative log likelihood function to be minimized. Perhaps a non-gradient-based global approach  , such as a genetic or simulated annealing technique might be more appropriate to this problem. In general  , we propose to maximize the following normalized likelihood function with a relative weight c~  , Which importance one gives to predicting terms relative to predicting links may depend on the specific application . The function of the mapping transitions is to transfer the token' s color c  , to a predefmed color cz  , i.e. Our goal is to obtain a precise position controller with high bandwidth shown in Fig. All 24 out of 24 QALD-4 queries  , with all there syntactic variations  , were correctly fitted in NQS  , giving a high sensitivity to structural variation. The necessary conditions for stability of vergence eye movements are obtained from 4are positive  , the poles of the conjugate eye movement transfer function are always negative  , and the conjugate eye movement is always stable. The queries are in line with the BSBM mix of SPARQL queries and with the BSBM e-commerce use case that considers products as well as offers and reviews for these products. However  , due to the presence of random noise in the measurement  , the result of the transfer function was not exactly the same for each task. The above transfer function meam a typical second order system. LIF  , on the other hand  , models term frequency/probability distributions and can be seen as a new approach to TF normalization . The parameters used to plot this transfer function were the same as those in Figure 3 driving frequency. It is necessary to design a motion planning method in order to execute these elements. Motion planning is a very challenging problem that involves complicated physical constraints and high-dimensional configuration spaces. The torque-based function measured failure likelihood and force-domain effects; the acceleration-based function measured immediate failure dynamics; and the swing-angle-based function measured susceptibility to secondary damage after a failure. The motivations of demote operation is as follows: making those queries that the evaluation function classifies as future cache hits stay in the cache longer. The full-order observer is designed so as not to significantly alter the dynamics of the closed-loop system. A summary of the hydrodynamic models developed by von K a r m h and Sears  , and Lighthill has been presented and has been applied to the investigation of elastic energy storage in a harmonically oscillating foil in a free stream. This function fills the role of Hence the quantity In the next section  , a probabilistic membership function PMF on the workspace is developed which describes the likelihood of sensing the object at a given location. Then 0 is determined from the mean value function. Since there is no guarantee of a unique extremum in the cost function   , a method like simulated annealing can be used to optimize the cost function 22. This would require extending the described techniques  , and creating new QA benchmarks. Gates' vision of " robots in every home " includes a Roomba  , a laundry-folding robot  , and a mobile assistive robot within the home  , with security and lawn-mowing robots outside 1. The probability that a target exists is modeled as a decay function based upon when the target was most recently seen  , and by whom. The underlying distribution of the unlabeled data is also investigated to choose the most representative examples 10. It follows that transformation of SDM into FSDM increases the importance of bigram matches  , which ultimately improves the retrieval performance  , as we will demonstrate next. The learned parameter can be then used to estimate the relevance probability P s|q k  for any particular aspect of a new user query. Mukhopadyay et al. In all our experiments  , the term frequency normalisation parameters are optimised using Simulated Annealing 15. A key feature of both models  , the motion model and the perceptual model  , is the fact that they are differentiable. Table 3shows these results. This work investigates the effect of the following techniques in reducing HTML document size  , both individually and in combination:  general tidying-up of document  , removal of proprietary tags  , folding of whitespace; Because the HTML under consideration is automatically generated and fits the DTD  , the parser need not be able to handle incorrect HTML; it can be much less robust than the parsers used by web browsers. Maximizing the margin enhances the generalization capability of a support vector machine 16. U Here the transfer function of the motor-gear system and the controller are replaced by a simplified system for conciseness. Indeed we know that a positive transfer function is typical of a spring  , while a negative transfer function is indicative of a mass. Essentially local techniques such as gradient descent  , the simplex method and simulated annealing are not well suited to such landscapes. Most research are focused on analyzing microarray gene expression either to determine significant pathways that contribute to a phenotype of interest or deal with features genes selection problem. After compensating for the friction and coupling torque  , the transfer function between the angle of the motor and the current is given by This is done by adding  , to the control current  , the current equivalent to these torques and is given by where C is the stiffness of the arm. Then  , a grid search is used to determine C and α that maximize the likelihood function. The elbow joint is analyzed exclusively in the following discussion because it was representative of the procedure used for all of the Schilling Titan I1 joints and it exhibited the most severe control challenges. Figure 4illustrates CSSA for the case where the user requires the best K solutions exceeding the similarity specified by target. The result is the modified assignment: Simulated annealing redispatches missions to penalize path overlapping. 's simulated annealing solver. A critical assumption is that evaders' motions are independent of the motions of the pursuer. Therefore  , 5 entries in the profile is sometimes not enough to compute a good similarity. For free motion case  , the object is to find the transfer function from the motor torque to tip position of the manipulator  , and in constrained case  , we want to find the transfer function from motor torque to the force exerted by the manipulator to the environment. While coupled  , or MIMO  , controllers have an inherently greater potential for being able to uncouple a coupled system they have several potential disadvantages  , including computational complexity and they do not lend themselves to modularity. This worked well when the demonstrations were all very similar  , but we found that our weighted squared-error cost function with rate-change penalty yielded better alignments in our setting  , in which the demonstrations were far less similar in size and time scale. This reward function gives relatively more priority to reducing the distance to the goal than to reducing the size of the command  , and the robot will apply larger torques to reduce the distance to the goal more quickly. Assume that the observed data is generated from our generative model. In a recent paper a virtual angle of rotation is suggested as an alternative output 6  and it is shown that the zerodynamics of the system arising from this output is stable. The closed loop frequency response is shown in figure 7. where  , controller  , and neglecting small higher order terms  , the total transfer function can be represented as the secmd order system. The likelihood function formed by assuming independence over the observations: That is  , the coefficients that make our observed results most " likely " are selected. The abduction angle characterizes the angle of the finger in the palm's plane  , whereas the flexion angle corresponds to the folding of the finger in the plane perpendicular to the palm. Surprisingly  , our simple rule based heuristic performed better than a support vector machine. For example   , an optimizer might include constant folding  , common subexpression elimination  , dead code elimination   , loop invariant code motion  , and inline expansion of procedure calls. First there is the transfer function representing the dynamics of the master arms Y ,. Therefore  , we can utilize convex optimization techniques to find approximate solutions. Although the main intended application of the apparatus is for in vivo experiments in physiology and for microsurgery  , in this phase we elected not to make tests with animals for ethical reasons. Equation 14 shows that the plant transfer function is a fourth order system with an integral term. Therefore  , when the likelihood of a region x in a test image is computed  , concepts whose pdf's were estimated from " similar looking " vectors rt will have high a posteriori probability 6. image regions rt from all images labeled with c contribute to the estimate of the probability density function pdf f x|c. We use the gradient decent method to optimize the objective function. The confidence of the learned classifier is then used as a similarity metric for the records. The rst two factors have been selected as the ones with the highest probablity to generate the word ight"  , the last two factors have the highest probability to generate the word love". In the framework of Support Vector Machine18  , three methods have been proposed to measure the uncertainty of simple data  , which are referred as simple margin  , MaxMin margin and ratio margin. For support vector machine  , the polynomial kernel with degree 3 was used. It is well known that for collocated measurements  , the transfer function is passive and hence it is easy to stablilise the system 4. We then train a two-class support vector machine with the labelled feature vectors. Ranked query evaluation is based on the notion of a similarity heuristic  , a function that combines observed statistical properties of a document in the context of a collection and a query  , and computes a numeric score indicating the likelihood that the document is an answer to the query. By using joints which can only fold in one direction  , theoretically  , feet would slap and stroke in a flat formation  , fold during retraction  , and avoid accidentally collapsing the cavity. The robotic gripper's primary function is to transfer pipes and move them into or out of the roughneck. More generally  , the models provide insight regarding the effects of various design parameters on jump gliding performance -for example  , to explore the merits of a more complex wing folding mechanism that reduces drag at the expense of greater weight  , or to evaluate the improvement possible with a reduced body area. One major default mode that can alterate this function is the seizing of the pump axis. Thus the likelihood function of appearance model 1 Appearance Model: Similar to 4  , 10   , the appearance model consists of three components S  , W  , F   , where S component captures temporally stable images  , W component characterizes the two-frame variations  , F component is a fixed template of the target to prevent the model from drifting over time. Our rationale for splitting F in this way is that  , according to empirical findings reported in 11  , the likelihood of a user visiting a page presented in a search result list depends primarily on the rank position at which the page appears. Surprisingly  , this simple rule based heuristic performs better than a Support Vector Machine based approach. where Fjy  , x is a feature function which extracts a realvalued feature from the label sequence y and the observation sequence x  , and Zx is a normalization factor for each different observation sequence x. This paper presents a novel technique for self-folding that utilizes shape memory polymers  , resistive circuits  , and structural design features to achieve these requirements and create two­ dimensional composites capable of self-folding into three­ dimensional devices. Likewise  , for the example in section 1.4  , the objective function at our desirable solutions is 0.5  , and have value 0.25 for the unpartitioned case. the inner and the outer loops and Qa/Tr for the proposed system  , respectively. Thus  , the key elements are terms w taken from a vocabulary V R of observed words in the literal values of RDF statements in R. To obtain realistic indices we apply common techniques from the field of Information Retrieval  , such as case folding and stemming. Since the appearance of microarray technology in to­ day's biological experiment  , gene expression data gen­ erated by various microarray experiments have in­ creased enormously  , and lots of works based on these data have been published. Since the numerators and denolminators have non odd powers of s  , the poles and zeros will be symmetric about the imaginary axis. Using the observation model and the likelihood function discussed in section II  , we formulate  , when N O = 1: To compute this number  , we first must be able to computê N H e r k |h i   , as the expected number of remaining hypotheses if the robot moves to e r k given that h i is the true position hypothesis. The experts were not involved in the development of any of the two tools and were not aware of which tool produces which verbalization. In this case  , the error is the difference between the setpoint and the measured value and the control signal is the dimmer value in the next time interval. For this  , we designed a scoring function to quantify the likelihood that a specific user would rate a specific attraction highly and then ranked the candidates accordingly. For instance  , many techniques model control flow and omit data  , thus folding together program states which differ only in variable values. When the developer requests a feature to be hidden  , CIDE just leaves a marker to indicate hidden code. We posit a modification scenario in which a developer is asked to modify the folding behaviour to automatically expand every nested level of folding when a user clicks on the fold marker. the characteristic equation becomes f1s=s 2 +KPs+KI. The likelihood function is determined relying on the ray casting operation which is closely related to the physics of the sensor but suffers from lack of smoothness and high computational expense. The target edge is also identified in the image and the relative distance between the two edges is calculated. We compare four methods for identifying entity aspects: TF. IDF  , the log-likelihood ratio LLR 2  , parsimonious language models PLM 3 and an opinion-oriented method OO 5 that extracts targets of opinions to generate a topic-specific sentiment lexicon; we use the targets selected during the second step of this method. A perfect success rate of 100% was achieved on the 50 end-to-end trials of previously untested towels. In PT modification  , which occurs in randomized and genetic strategies  , states are complete IQ  , an action is a transform or a crossover method and the goal description involves a stop condition based on specific parameters of the search strategies e.g. This ideal situation occurs when a search engine's repository is exactly synchronized with the Web at all times  , such that W L = W. Hence  , we denote the highest possible search repository quality as QW  , where: As long as the inspection likelihood function Ir is monotonically nonincreasing  , the expected cumulative score of visited pages is maximized when pages are always presented to users in descending order of their true score SWp  , q. More specifically  , our approach assigns to each distance value t  , a density probability value which reflects the likelihood that the exact object reachability distance is equal to t cf. The servo control was implemented by integrating a high speed low resolution vision system with the cell controller  , and it was applied simultaneously with a tension servo control. Four experimental urban courses similar in difficulty were created from differently-sized boxes. The transfer function P , ,s of the velocity response model has been assumed to be the transfer function P f  s  of the force response model as multiplied by a transfer function that represents the inertia of the output part and the determined experimentally. The transfer function of the charge amplifier Gc& can be assumed as the 10b. This function selects a particle at random  , with a likelihood of selection proporational to the particle's normalized weight. The present paper extends this concept  , provides new results for ligand-protein binding  , and explores the application of PCRs to protein folding. In this paper we have demonstrated a novel technique for self-folding using shape-memory polymers and resistive heating that is capable of several fabrication features: sequen­ tial folding  , angle-controlled folds  , slot-and-tab assembly  , and mountain-valley folding. All shapes folded themselves in under 7 minutes. The planner generates this path by performing a bestfirst search of the connected component using a simple distance function. Furtlierinore  , we may assiinie that the adjacent frequency bins H  , That is  , each component of the transfer function is corrected by where 1 = 1  , ..   , N   , the forgetting factor A  , satibfies 0 < A  , 5 1  , and P  , is tlie covariance matrix. The EM approach indeed produced significant error reductions on the training dataset after just a few iterations. We compared the resulting ranking to the set of input rankings. The first two rules generate the predicate concepts corresponding to preconditions prec from a SPM  , where the function gc : T → CONC is used to generate the concept corresponding to a given term and the function gcc : PR CC → CONC is used to generate the concept corresponding to a given precondition predicate: The developed rules use the ← r operator to denote set reunion and the ← a operator to denote a value transfer. However  , query classification was not extensively applied to query dependent ranking  , probably due to the difficulty of the query classification problem. gripper mechanism was developed as an endeffector because gripper mechanisms are used very often in laparoscopic surgery. In this experiment  , the robot motion obtained by the simulation is implemented. Given the training data  , we maximize the regularized log-likelihood function of the training data with respect to the model  , and then obtain the parameterˆλparameterˆ parameterˆλ. c Learning on unlocked table: robot correctly estimates a mass and friction that reproduce the observed trajectory. Control then passes to the host partition with the message: FunctionCall INITIALIZEGLOBALS NIL. Representation is necessary since the company running the web site wishes to pick a subset of ads such that a certain objective function e.g. Such cases call for alternative methods for deriving statistically efficient estimators. Both transfer function have two zeros and four poles. the transfer functions of the PMBLDC motor  , drive  , speed and current controllers respectively. A variety of transformations may be employed  , including function folding and unfolding  , data type refinement  , and optimizing transformations. Negations within questions and improved ranking will also be considered. While the BSBM benchmark is considered as a standard way of evaluating RDB2RDF approaches  , given the fact that it is very comprehensive  , we were also interested in analysing real-world queries from projects that we had access to  , and where there were issues with respect to the performance of the SPARQL to SQL query rewriting approach. For purposes of this paper  , the authors define the bandwidth of transparency as the frequency at which the transparency transfer function crosses a A3 dB magnitude band. The previous transfer function 15 represents the CDPR dynamics and it depends on the pose X of the robot. has a constant transfer function which is required to work in a changing environment. The position method has the important advantage of yielding a second order closed-loop transfer function and is thus always stable in the continuous-time case if the coefficients are positive. It is easy to note that when ς=0  , then the objective function is the temporally regularized log likelihood as in equation 5. where the parameter ς controls the balance between the likelihood using the multinomial theme model and the smoothness of theme distributions over the participant graph. Its reaction is modeled by an admittance with serial spring-damper dynamics with the transfer function s/s + 0.5. The resulting blogs were classified using a Support Vector Machine trained on a manually labelled subset of the TREC Blogs08 dataset. To find a near-optimal solution  , we employed the simulated annealing method which has been shown effective for solving combinatorial optimization problems. For the QALD experiments described later  , we annotated the query using DBpedia Spotlight 7. Inference and learning in these models is typically intractable  , and one must resort to approximate methods for both. In Section 4 we describe our evaluation using the BSBM synthetic benchmark  , and three positive experiences of applying our approach in real case projects. In these techniques  , the state space is considerably simplified by comparison to actual program execution  , but may still be too large to exhaustively enumerat ,e. Additional folding of implementation details may occur in simulations based executable specifications such as Petri nets or PATSley ZSSS. They can be modelled by a probability density function indicating the likelihood that an object is located at a certain position cf. However  , achieving this is computationally intractable. During query execution the engine determines trust values with the simple  , provenance-based trust function introduced before. As mentioned earlier  , a 3D-NDT model can be viewed as a probability density function  , signifying the likelihood of observing a point in space  , belonging to an object surface as in 4 Instead of maximizing the likelihood of a discrete set of points M as in the previous subsection   , the registration problem is interpreted as minimizing the distance between two 3D-NDT models M N DT F and M N DT M. The control system in Figure 6was used to induce step inputs and measure the robot joint's dynamic response at each temperature state. The goal of this step is to take the 2D crease structure and the fold angles of a mesh as input and generate a crease structure that will self-fold the desired angles. Then the likelihood function of an NHPP is given by Let θ be given by the time-dependent parameter sets  , θ = θ1  , θ2  , · · ·   , θI . where α is the weight that specifies a trade-off between focusing on minimization of the log-likelihood of document sequence and of the log-likelihood of word sequences we set α = 1 in the experiments  , b is the length of the training context for document sequences  , and c is the length of the training context for word sequences. QALD-2 has the largest number of queries with no performance differences  , since both FSDM and SDM fail to find any relevant results for 28 out of 140 queries from this fairly difficult query set. The end result will be the automated generation of the following descriptors for video: Speakers by folding in speaker recognition systems working from the audio to cluster speeches by the same person   , affording a natural and powerful way of smoothing the distributions. The service activation and execution function report costs only when the execution site referred in the grounding parameter of the functions is the current execution site. 18  propose three margin based methods in Support Vector Machine to select examples for querying which reduce the version space as much as possible. After the integration  , we can maximize the following log-likelihood function with the relative weight λ. Probabilistic graphical models can further be grouped into generative models and discriminative models. The experimental results in Table 5show that exploiting the emergent relational schema even in this very preliminary implementation already improves the performance of Virtuoso on a number of BSBM Explore queries by up to a factor of 5.8 Q3  , Hot run. einstein relativ-ity theory "   , " tango music composers "   , " prima ballerina bolshoi theatre 1960 " ;  QALD-2: the Question Answering over Linked Data query set contains natural language questions of 4 different types: e.g. The low-end cut off of the transfer function is -25.7dBu 40mV and the highend attenuation point is -7.7dBu 320mV. With the same objective  , genetic search strategies Goldberg891 can be applied to query optimization  , as a generalization of randomized ones EibengOl. In order to transfer the knowledge smoor;hly  , the state spaces in both the previous and current stages should be consistent with each other. Most proposed teleoperation modeling works adopt the term F * e to represent the environment internal force as shown in Fig. As the software development progresses  , we make the lookahead prediction of the number of software faults in the subsequent incremental system testing phase  , based on the NHPP-based SRMs. During pipe transfer and placement  , slips may occur along the pipe's axis. The force control for the experiments uses an inner velocity loop. Second  , we use this distribution to derive the maximum-likelihood location of individuals with unknown location and show that this model outperforms data provided by geolocation services based on a person's IP address. We use the unstable branch of Z3 9  , which has better support for quantifiers  , for checking the constraints generated during cycle detection  , type checking  , and test-case generation. With the values of the physical and control parameters used to produce the experiment of Fig. Since the resulting NHPP-based SRM involves many free parameters   , it is well known that the commonly used optimization technique such as the Newton method does not sometimes work well. In addition  , the beam-based sensor models excluding the seeing through problem described in Sec. Since the confidence level is low  , the interval estimate is to be discarded. However when more and more data have to be added  , the error accumulates to undesirable proportions. SQUALL2SPARQL takes an inputs query in SQUALL  , which is a special English based language  , and translates it to SPARQL. Alternate approaches have to be found to make the transfer function appear passive for the case when is large. The empirical transfer function r��:� is also plotted. Every block traveled adds one unit to the cost function  , and each transfer contributes four units but takes a negligible time to execute. It comprises two sets of 50 questions over DBpedia   , annotated with SPARQL queries and answers. Thus  , by the Passivity theorem  , a P D controller can provide very good vibration control. One is the time-dependent content similarity measure between queries using the cosine kernel function; another is the likelihood for two queries to be grouped in a same cluster from the click-through data given the timestamp. This paper presents our research work on automatic question classification through machine learning approaches  , especially the Support Vector Machines. Each evaluator wrote down his steps in constructing the query. One of the common solutions is to use the posterior probability as opposed to the likelihood function. Let Y H be the random variable that represents the label of the observed feature vector in the hypothesis space  , and Y F be the random variable that represents the label in the target function. The diameter function of the thin slice is shown in dotted lines along with its transfer function. where  , controller  , and neglecting small higher order terms  , the total transfer function can be represented as the secmd order system. A commonly used sensor model in literature is the range model  , where the detection likelihood is a function of the distance between sensor and target positions 7  , 13. A class of outputs which lead to a minimum phase transfer function for single-link flexible robots have been presented in 8. the person in charge For promptly sending warning messages to the person in charge  , a message delivery mechanism is designed in the Watchdog component. We used the robotic system to measure gap junction function. The Berlin SPARQL Benchmark 17 BSBM also generates fulltext content and person names. For a noncompliant motion Eq.5 describes a decoupled system  , which is generally not true in case of compliant motion. We use MLE method to estimate the population of web robots. We now describe results on paper folding and protein fold­ ing problems obtained using our PRM-based approach. Several simplified systems were used to study the effect of hysteresis  , for example  , a constant force was subtracted to account for the effect of damping and friction but the best results as far as matching the experimental data were given by the transfer function: Hysteresis: Similar to friction and damping  , a simplified model of the hysteresis was used and the describing function computed. We point out some design constraints on the configuration of the coils and the permanent magnets  , and discuss briefly calibration and accuracy of the motor. The transfer function of When D = 0  , the system is said to be strictly causal. Ultimately we used 92 bilingual aspects from 33 topics  , including 3 Chinese aspects that could only be used as training data for English aspect classification because each of them had only 4 segments. We omit the details of the derivation dealing with these difficulties and just state the parameters of the resulting vMF likelihood function: are not allowed to take any possible angle in Ê n−1 . Simulated annealing is a capable of crossing local minima and locating the global minimum 6. It is well known that if actuator and sensor are located at the same point co-location then the transfer function is passive and thus it is possible to develop a very simple controller. It is shown that if the tip-position is chosen as the output  , and the joint-torque is chosen as the input  , then the transfer function of the system is non-minimum phase. Both benchmarks allow for the creation of arbitrary sized data sets  , although the number of attributes for any given class is lower than the numbers found in the ssa. Our main research question is " Is folding the facets panel in a digital library search interface beneficial to academic users ? " Transfer of control from a menu to a function is specified by evaluation of a mapping whose evaluation represents execution of the function and whose value represents the state in which the system returns to the menu. Integrating all the factors together  , we obtain the following log-likelihood objective function: We adopt the influences learned in the previous stage as the input factors  , and learn the weighting parameters. The object identification method here presented relies on composition and interpolation of object patterns . Figure 7 shows the result of simulated annealing in trajectory planning when applied to the example in figure 6d. Opposite of the closed loop forward transfer function   , the impedance at low frequency is equal to zero. Simulation results are plotted in Figures 7-11. The system was simulated to aid understanding of the control problem  , to identify a suitable transfer function and to determine the vision system specification. Two synthetic datasets generated using RDF benchmark generators BSBM 2 and SP2B 3 were used for scalability evaluation. Extension of the simulated annealing technique include the mean field annealing 13 and the tree annealing 1141. Secondly  , when each design team turned to the problem of realizing their switching or transfer function or state table  , there would be many more analytical techniques at their disposal. When the sequence length t is large  , the huge number of classes makes the multi-class Support Vector Machine infeasible. It is only recently  , for example  , that IBM announced plans to build the world's fastest supercomputer — Blue Gene — which will attempt to compute the three-dimensional folding of human protein molecules. To simplify our experiments  , we dropped the document segments that were in the gold standard but were not in the ranked list of selected retrieved segments although we could have kept them by folding them into the LSA spaces. The system uses a threshold policy to present the top 10 users corresponding to contexts similar above θ = 0.65  , a value determined empirically to best balance the tradeoff between relevance  , and the likelihood of seeing someone else as we go on to describe in following sections. The s ,pecification of the optimizer example includes the definition of two tree types: initial representing the abstract syntax of the source language with no embedded attributes on any abstract syntax tree node  , and live representing the abstract syntax of the source language with live on exit facts embedded in do state- ments. We estimated 2s + 1 means  , but assumed that all of the output functions shared a common covariance matrix. 36 train a support vector machine to extract mathematical expressions and their natural language phrase. This result is in agreement with 27 albeit we perform this comparison on a much higher number of datasets. One can design a positioning compensator to develop a tracklng system such that the closed-loop system IS always robust to the bounded uncertalnties In the open loop dynamlcs of the robot. For example  , in the above online banking system  , assume that after aspectization  , a new function transfer is added and also has locking  , i.e. when assuming that n defects are contained in the document . As such  , skills do not transfer well from one environment to the next  , from one robot platform to another  , and from simulation to reality. where µi ∈ R denotes a user-specific offset. Note that search engine operations such as stemming and case-folding may preclude highlighting by re-scanning the retrieved documents for the search terms. In this way  , we can represent a DTD or Schema structure as a set of parallel trees  , which closely resemble DTD/Schema syntax  , with links connecting some leaves with some roots  , in a graph-like manner. Each self-folding hinge must be approximately 10 mm long or folding will not occur  , limiting the total minimum size of the mechanism. NL interfaces are attractive for their ease-of-use  , and definetely have a role to play  , but they suffer from a weak adequacy: habitability spontaneous NL expressions often have no FL counterpart or are ambiguous  , expressivity only a small FL fragment is covered in general. Atkeson and Schaal 11 describe work in which a reward function and a model for a task are learned by observing a human demonstratc thc task. We consider these cost values as edge weights  , and therefore the Dijkstra's search can be applied to find a trajectory with the smallest cost-to-go. To overcome these challenges  , BIGDEBUG provides an on-demand watchpoint with a guard closure function . In reducing total prediction error MNSE and AME polynomial kernel produced the best result while in predicting trend DS  , CU and CD radial basis and polynomial kernel produced equally good results. Since the maximum value is 3 the interval estimate has -yg-  , a high confidence level. Equation 1 8 shows a twodimensional example for choice of D  s l where m l and m2  , representing the apparent masses in various directions  , are the designers choice. Hence the quantity In the next section  , a probabilistic membership function PMF on the workspace is developed which describes the likelihood of sensing the object at a given location. During learning phase  , the support vector machine will be trained to learn the edge and non­ edge pattern. The observed signals are divided in time into overlapping frames by the application of a window function and analyzed using the short-time Fourier transform STFT. 5 Query Likelihood Model with Submodular Function: rerank retrieved questions by query likelihood model system 1 using submodular function Eqn.13. Furthermore  , it creates and initializes the pools. It first understands the NL query by extracting phrases and labeling them as resource  , relation  , type or variable to produce a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG. We now present the form of the likelihood function appearing in Eqs. In addition  , the friction loss is very small due to no wire folding at each joint. Therefore  , there are no differences in drive characteristics hetween vertical and horizontal directions   , and so this new joint system provides smoother drive compared with the active universal joint described in our previous reports. We also look at friendship probability as a function of rank where rank is the number of people who live closer than a friend ranked by distance  , and note that in general  , people who live in cities tend to have friends that are more scattered throughout the country. This also happens to be the KB that we did more experiments on since it provided more complexity and more representative prob- lems. As the chart illustrates  , determing trust values during query execution dominates the query execution time. This figure shows a sensor scan dots at the outside  , along with the likelihood function grayly shaded area: the darker a region  , the smaller the likelihood of observing an obstacle. Whenever an external force is applied to the hand controller  , the end-point of the hand controller will move in response. More generally  , let I be the number of samples collected and the probability that an individual j is captured in sample i be pij. On each axis  , the likelihood probability gets projected as a continuous numeric function with maximum possible score of 1.0 for a value that is always preferred  , and a score of 0.0 for a value that is absent from the table. However  , it is not true because the likelihood function is represented as the product of the probabilities that the debugging history in respective incremental system testing can be realized. 'fico control is used to suppress the effect of uncertainties by minimizing the oo-norm of the system's closed-loop transfer function. There is some positive transfer between the initial learning and performance with the new reward function: the initial cost is lower and the ultimate performance is slightly better with pretraining. The likelihood function is considered to be a function of the parameters Θ for the Digg data. 1 Several of the design metrics are ratios and many instances show zero denominators and therefore undefined values. where αi and α k are Lagrange multipliers of the constraints with respect to pnvj |z k   , we need to consider the original PLSA likelihood function and the user guidance term. Even thouglh simulated annealing is a very powerful technique  , it has the uncertainties associated with a randomized approach. In what follows we will ignore amplification and motor transfer function issues and assume a   ,  t  can be specified directly. This case occurs when both slave arm located at remote site and simulated model interact with environment . Consider the enormous state space  , and a likelihood function with rather narrow peaks. In this discussion  , we will focus on the transfer function between actuator position/velocity and the actuator force  , as the phase relationship between these will relate to our optimal spring problem. To maximize the overall log likelihood  , we can maximize each log likelihood function separately. proposed a simulated annealing approach with several heuristics 9  , and Mathioudakis et al. As fundamental function of GPS receivers  , not only its position measurement data hut also measurement indexes such as DOP Dilution Of Precision  , the number of satellites etc are available from the receiver. For fair comparison  , we used the same five field entity representation scheme and the same query sets as in 33  Sem- Search ES consisting primarily of named entity queries  , List- Search consisting primarily of entity list search queries  , QALD- 2 consisting of entity-focused natural language questions  , and INEX-LD containing a mix of entity-centric queries of different type. Since the transfer function matrix in Eq.
