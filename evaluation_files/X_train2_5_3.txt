In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.Evaluation
To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.Thus both clusters are left intact.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.that must have her mark intact.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.His visual fields are intact.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.The rest of the order was preserved intact.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.Technorati.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.We leave the smaller leaf intact.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.If q = −1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.According to a recent survey made by Technorati
