This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.We leave the smaller leaf intact.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection 
One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.His visual fields are intact.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors

Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.  dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20    , selected using LocusLink information.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation

We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.This realization has led various retail giants such as WalMart 
RELATED WORK
An attempt has been made to make the process of hiring an auto simpler by an initiative launched in Bangalore by the city police and the transport authority    , called Easy Auto 4 .In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.LabelMe 4 .We then give details on the key Quora graph structures that connect different components together.The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.It is likely that monitoring all items for sale at Walmart    , say    , is not of interest.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Ellen Spertus for her assistance with the Orkut data    , and Tim Heilman for his assistance with generating datasets for semantic query similarity.As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.Semantic Search Engine 
The dictionary for finding gene mentions was automatically derived from the full LocusLink database    , and included 156  ,533 genes with a total of 387  ,850 synonyms.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.  , Walmart.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.As a case study    , we collect a Chinese hotel review dataset from booking.com.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink 
CONCEPT EXTRACTION.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.  , Live Search    , Ask.com    , or AltaVista    , and contained either search engine result pages    , visits to search engine homepages    , or pages connected by a hyperlink trail to a search result page.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.If q = −1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 Introduction
 The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population TAC-KBP Slot Filling SF task 
1 Supervised classification.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.We observe similar trends in Quora.To study the effect of q which is the length of NBC for each projected dimension    , we evaluate our MH methods on 22K LabelMe and 100K TinyImage by setting the q to three different values 2    , 3    , and 4.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.By distributing tasks or questions to large numbers of Internet users    , these " crowd-sourcing " systems have done everything from answering user questions Quora    , to translating books    , creating 3-D photo tours 
WWW 
CROWDTURFING OVERVIEW
 In this section    , we introduce the core concepts related to crowdturfing .UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.REFERENCES

Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases    , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.Thus both clusters are left intact.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.Impact on Voting
 Quora applies a voting system that leverages crowdsourced efforts to promote good answers.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .In 
Stability of Quora topics 
 In this section    , we shall perform stability analysis of the popular topics.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.BBJoin Cost costBBJoin / BOJoin Cost cost
Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.Orkut also offers friend relationship.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com 
¯ F x = 1 − F x = P X > x 
on log-log axes.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 
.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.The rest of the order was preserved intact.The data provided by AcroMed 4     , LocusLink 5     , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .
