 In this paper    , we evaluate the performance for the Zipflike distribution as is used in the AS3AP benchmarks 
iz X fi = 1 conslad' 1 5 i 5 n 
In this formula    , z is the decay factor and constant' is the n-th harmonic number of order z.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.The probability of generating the expansion terms is defined as 
P Q | Θ D  = |Q | q i P q i | Θ D  w i W 4 
where q i is a expansion term    , W = |Q | i=1 w i and w i is the weight we give to a expansion term    , which we can see as the relatedness between the original query Q and the expansion term    , and is computed as 
w i = P q | Q = N j=1 P q | c j P c j | Q 5 
 where c is a concept returned by the expansion algorithm     , N is the number of concepts we chose for the expansion    , P q | c j  is estimated using the sense probabilities estimated from Semcor i.e.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.A clinical semantic knowledge is established from these terms extracted by matching UMLS.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.The semantic types in UMLS are based on categories such as organisms and chemicals.We used a version of the LocusLink database containing 128  ,580 entries.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book;

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.If a phrase that contained a number of UMLS strings was to appear in the report text    , such as " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation    , " it would be tagged in this case as containing five different UMLS concepts: " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. "In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.For WebKB dataset we learnt 10 topics.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 .We find this method is effective at recovering ground truth quality parameters     , and further show that it provides a good fit for Reddit and Hacker News data.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .To systematically identify all the GDELT themes and taxonomies that are related to climate change we first built the co-occurrence graph among them.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers 
TPC-W Benchmark

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Pinterest

CROWDTURFING OVERVIEW
 In this section    , we introduce the core concepts related to crowdturfing .We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.We take migration to be a substantial shift in activity    , wherein the user's smoothed activity is higher on alternatives than on Reddit for at least two weeks.Query Expansion
UMLS Related Terms Query Expansion
The UMLS metathesaurus contains a couple of large tables that relate concepts to one another.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.Present scale and span
 So far    , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties    , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events    , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?Reddit and each of the remaining 21 alternative platforms were crawled for all publicly available content.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.Using Neo4j    , a graph building API for Java    , we constructed a graph of UMLS    , where the nodes were concepts and the edges were relationships from the UMLS related terms table.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.Differences in Social Support 
Does the nature of feedback or social support from the greater reddit community also differ in the case of posts from anonymous accounts  ?EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset 
Experimental Results
8 in Section 3.3.If q = −1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .On the BDBComp collection    , SAND outperformed two unsupervised methods in more than 36% under the pF1 metric and in more 4% under the K metric.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     ,

 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.The results are shown in 
Reddit and Hacker News
Given that our model effectively recovers ground truth data from the MusicLab experiment    , we now evaluate the fit of the Poisson model to Reddit and Hacker News voting data.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.On Reddit    , over half of articles were discarded because they appeared for less than an hour in the range of positions studied.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.Weights of query concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.BDBComp has been designed to be OAI compliant and adopts Dublin Core DC as its metadata standard.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.The annotators unified their schemes by consensus into a hierarchical scheme with 6 coarse-grained and 31 fine-grained motivational factors additional details available at networkdynamics.org/pubs/2016/reddit-exodus/.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.UMLS Network Query Expansion
This technique represents perhaps our most unique approach to this problem.Each UMLS atom may have multiple semantic types and possibly multiple semantic groups.On Reddit    , users employ subreddits to discuss everything from crochet to conspiracy theories.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.The dataset in 
Characterizing affixes 
The goal of this section is to explore the types of canonical affixes users on Reddit utilize.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.The Mean Average Precision MAP results for HGT and NIPS are shown in 
SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.Conclusion 
We have presented    , to the best of our knowledge    , the first comprehensive study of mental health discourse on the social media reddit.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.GDELT contains a set of entities for each article ; however    , we ignored these annotations and solely relied on our own methods to extract and disambiguate entities.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.For each word    , we construct the time series of its occurrence in New York Times articles.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.Finally    , dual citizens have activity on alternatives that was sustained for longer than one week    , but their activity is not consistently higher on alternatives than Reddit.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.Section 2 describes the size    , origin    , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.Our data starts in October 2007    , but Reddit existed before that.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.3 How would you grade your knowledge of bibliographic self-archiving after using the BDBComp service  ?This enriched metadata could then be distributed to meet the needs of access services    , preservation repositories    , and external aggregation services such as OAIster.– The gene ExpressionPattern being revealed in the image    , as defined by the Drosophila anatomy ontology 5 .Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.Experimental Setup
For our input dictionary we use the Unified Medical Language System UMLS.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.We define a video to be " discovered " on Reddit if it's score was in the top 10% of scores of posts to r/videos in 2012.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Thus both clusters are left intact.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.We have used the 2008AA version of the UMLS in all of our experiments.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.SemEval Keyphrase Extraction Data
In addition to our four collections of index terms    , we used an existing dataset for keyphrase extraction evaluation — the SemEval-2010 keyphrase extraction data.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We take as our benchmark the SemEval-2012 task on Measuring Degrees of Relational Similarity 
Model 
Comparison systems.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.Given the data types of the TPC-W benchmark    , we categorized these data types as shown in 
Costs.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.We are encouraged by our method's ability to recover ground truth from the MusicLab experiment but we recognize that although Reddit and Hacker News are similar in some ways    , they are fundamentally different.We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Pinterest
Pinterest is a pinboard-style image sharing social network    , where everything is about photos and videos.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.However    , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen    , available as Shapefiles 10 .A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .Interestingly    , the most popular forum among U. S. workers is Reddit HWTF while international workers are most likely to use MTurkForum.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.However    , many the expansions provided by UMLS consist of phrasal expressions e.g. "Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.Prior literature in biomedical WSD uses older versions of UMLS data    , e.g.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .time

CONCLUSIONS
We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.Queries for UMLS-CUI indexes
We created three versions of queries for UMLS-CUI indexes as follows: 1.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times more documents than ER does per day.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.Hotel Data
Data Description: We collected 4792 reviews about a well-known hotel brand from TripAdvisor.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.Xanga.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.To measure the relevance between UMLS concepts    , we used personalized PageRank PPR on an ontology graph constructed with a subset of the UMLS concepts.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.For the large dataset    , we use a real chemical compound dataset referred to here as PubChem.GDELT releases data about daily media coverage in two formats: the Event Database and the Global Knowledge Graph GKG.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB 
Comparisons.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality     , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user-spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the personality of recommendation system.SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor    , this is representative of the current state of the art systems

.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.While discerning ironic comments on reddit is our immediate task    , the proposed approach is generally applicable to a wide-range of subjective     , web-based text classification tasks.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.A UMLS term was considered to be negated 
After lemmatizing the UMLS strings using the GATE stemmer    , we used a trie containing all the UMLS strings with their associated concept IDs to identify exact matches of these strings in the lemmatized corpus and to store the concept IDs for indexing.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified    , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.The What block of 
CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.Therefore    , we compare our approach with two competitive systems from RepLab 2013:  Best RepLab 
Failure Analysis
topic Charity    , with 92 tweets    , that refers to the Barefoot Foundation and can be detected by the keyword support or the hashtag #BuyABrick.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.In this paper    , we construct a dataset from Reddit and present the first large-scale study on the coexistence of highly related communities.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.Evaluation
Ideally we would like to evaluate our quality estimates against some ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.One is the absolute value of antonyms experimental result denoting antonymous degree that is shown in 
SemEval experiment
 The datasets of Evaluating Chinese Word Similarity task In SemEval 2012 is used as the experimental data    , of which the values are normalized as 
Conclusions and Future work
 This paper proposes a new approach for computing word similarity between Chinese words using HowNet.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.2. candidates: A possibly empty list of UMLS candidate concepts identified in the phrase.We will refer to this version as UMLS-CUI-sen. Once the four versions of the concept documents are obtained     , we build the four corresponding UMLS-CUI indexes using Indri.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004

Results and discussions
Table 3 presents the macro-averaged F1 scores on the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.The resuiting TDT corpus includes 15  ,863 news stories spanning July 1    , 1994    , through June 30    , 1995.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.For the UMLS CUI indexes    , however    , some additional processing was required.In our analysis of GitHub

 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.GDELT indexes documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average    , whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.Various celebrities and noteworthy personalities have used reddit as a means to interact with Internet users    , such conversations fall under the Ask-Me-Anything and its variant subreddits.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .The other two measures are defined according to the standard measures to evaluate the performance of classification     , that is    , precision    , recall and F1-measure 
F 1 = 2 × P × R/P + R 11 
" performance " adopted by KDDCUP 2005 is in fact F1.The UMLS semantic network describes semantic relations such as causes between two semantic types.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times 
Related research is briefly discussed in Section 2.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.The third dataset is the second largest in Wikia    , Muppet    , whose articles are about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.Experimental Environment

Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.This work is a preliminary exploration    , focusing on a set of high precision reddit communities    , however expanding to other subreddits is a ripe area of future research.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.However we cannot directly estimate the probability of receiving a vote versus not receiving a vote    , for both Reddit and Hacker News.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.We also used private messaging PM features on Reddit and Voat to solicit participation from randomly-selected users.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.For SRAA dataset we learnt 10 topics on the complete dataset and labeled these 10 topics for all the three classification tasks.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .Synonyms of these genes were retrieved from UMLS.To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.  , Walmart.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.The Gerbil platform already integrates the methods of Agdis- tis

Discussion.Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.SemRep identifies relationships between UMLS concepts in text within the sentences.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.The other dataset contains 200 reviews randomly selected from Tripadvisor.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.In contrast    , tourists exhibit a sudden burst in activity on Reddit alternatives and then no further activity there.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.length on FBIS.The conceptual indexing of queries and documents is based on using UMLS concepts.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.Main experiments
In Table 1    , the results of Siamese CBOW on 20 SemEval datasets are displayed    , together with the results of the baseline systems.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.University of Amsterdam Team

 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.BIB 
Questions were put to us concerning the accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes.We would like to improve the search and discovery experience on OAIster by allowing users to restrict search results by subject.electric current."This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events    , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 Introduction
 The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population TAC-KBP Slot Filling SF task 
1 Supervised classification.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.In particular    , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.Patient summaries were mapped to UMLS codes using MetaMap.gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.We identified synonyms using a combination of tools from the UMLS.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.Therefore     , the MESUR owl:ObjectProperty taxonomy provides two types of object properties: ContextProperty and InferredProperty see

Results and Discussion
 This paper presented preliminaries for the development of a generic OWL/DLbased formalism for the representation of linguistic corpora.Besides    , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference    , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.The UMLS Semantic Network was also included in the Semantic Web.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.To describe those segments    , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.In addition to listing the citing articles    , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.Note that as ImageNet is still a resource under development    , not all word pairs in the datasets presented in section 4 are covered.,b1n .For this we have detailed the steps involved and how the UMLS can be used.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method 
Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.One is the Unified Medical Language System UMLS 
UMLS contains a very large dictionary of biomedical terms – the UMLS Metathesaurus and defines a hierarchy of semantic types – the UMLS Semantic Network.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.Consider all the suggested queries QTDT     , TP  that are    , both in the list that is dwelled for no shorter than TDT     , and    , ranked at positions no lower than TP dwell time ≥ TDT and position ≤ TP .Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.Introduction

Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The overall average gap is 749 days since 2008    , when users on Reddit were first allowed to create their own communities.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.This is the context of the node with its UMLS concepts attached to each atomic formula.The relationships between atomic formulae discovered from the UMLS are converted to their propositional equivalents.The Topic Model
In this paper we use the topic model for subject metadata enrichment of the OAIster collection.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.7 GDELT covers a " cross-section of all major international    , national    , regional    , local    , and hyper-local news sources    , both print and broadcast    , from nearly every corner of the globe " 8 including major international news sources.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark

Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .There are large numbers of tags and users; orders of magnitude larger than the 1  ,000 categories of ImageNet.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.For example if we query the UMLS for the term heart we find that heart has a total of 5 concepts from the UMLS.First    , we present an effective approach to reputation dimensions classification that achieves a state-of-the-art performance on the RepLab 2014 dataset by enriching the tweet with highly informative terms.pins for majority to appear 
PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.The query thus defines a modified Location-Dependent Skyline Query as formulated by

The generated query with a runtime of 42 ms now contains a WITHIN preference for a polygon defining the administrative boundary of the 'Fatih' district as retrieved from the integrated OpenStreetMap data.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.  , Live Search    , Ask.com    , or AltaVista    , and contained either search engine result pages    , visits to search engine homepages    , or pages connected by a hyperlink trail to a search result page.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.We also identified synonyms using UMLS and added them to the query.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset

Our baseline system is re-implementation of Hiero    , a hierarchical phrase-based system 
Experimental results on FBIS corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and our lexicalized reordering model.The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors     , such as location    , gender and age 6 .While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.The BLOG06 collection contains approximately 100k feed documents    , which are a mix of ATOM and RSS XML.LabelMe 4 .Although the absolute performance of the best learned function seems low 0.63 accuracy    , we will see in the following sections that    , once the classification confidence is used as similarity measure    , it leads to the best topic detection performance reported on the RepLab dataset so far.To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .UMLS
The Unified Medical Language System metathesaurus UMLS is a near-comprehensive list of biomedical concepts.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.Data
The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.We use GDELT    , currently the largest global event catalog    , to automatically discover relevant events with high MSM coverage.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.Raw text was extracted from the XML format of the AQU- AINT-2 and Blog06 collections.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.We filter out the photos that are not located in the city by latitude and longitude boundary as shown in 
Evaluation Measure
We extract a set of tourist attractions in the metadata of OpenStreetMap.SNOMED or UMLS seem to be better options.From the TripAdvisor data    , we randomly sampled 650 threads.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.aggregation ingestion

Figure 1: Overview of MESUR project phases.Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.User query strings were extracted by automated means from a sample of OAIster transaction logs recorded a few days each month over several months in 2003 and 2004.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.Every Concept 
 in the UMLS is related to another concept in the UMLS hierarchy via Broader Than RB    , Narrower Than RN    , Parent PAR    , Child CHD and Sibling SIB relationships    , this information being contained within the MRREL table of the UMLS.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.Orkut also offers friend relationship.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.Rel Doc Densities

Effectiveness Without Any Training
To analyze the effectiveness of our method without using any training example    , we execute NC with default eters i.e.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Reddit Reddit is composed of many different subcommunities called " subreddits " .The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.Dataset Description

 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.  , features 7–12 in 
Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.The other two AMA's are open to a more wider audience for sharing their life events and allowing other reddit users to ask questions related to those events.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources

in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.bl1  ,bl2  ,.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.Each scanned document was run through OCR; there are 646 documents whose OCRed text was hand-corrected.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the 
 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.Therefore    , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.It would be useful to search for objects using multiple pre-trained visual detection models    , such as a 200-class ImageNet Detection model and a 1  ,000-class ImageNet Recognition and Localisation model.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.a BeerAdvocate; b RateBeer.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.The first term is as in 
New York Times Articles N > 2 
We perform our approach on New York Times articles.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.The baseline system is not sufficient to her 
UMLS and MetaMap
The UMLS UMLS    , 2012    , or Unified Medical Language System    , is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies.BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.  , the UMLS dataset we use in the experiment have less than 1% positive triples.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.We would also like to thank the University of Michigan for the sample of OAIster transaction log data used in our analyses.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.Evaluation
 Our final run on the evaluation portion of TDT-2 produced 146 clusters.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.BBJoin Cost costBBJoin / BOJoin Cost cost
Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.We use the Comparison between GDELT and ER Scale One of the most important criteria for the comparison is the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehensive the dataset is.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.  , OpenStreetMap is about 300 GB.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.Harvested metadata that has no corresponding digital resource is not indexed in OAIster.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.We used part of UMLS hierarchy weights P@10 Avg.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.Settings for the Experiments

CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.One might conjecture either that MTurkGrind has developed into an independent    , more socialized community partly from a pool of Reddit HWTF users    , or that MTurk- Grind has started to attract users from Reddit HWTF who seek more social interactions.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."Participants

Reputation Dimensions Classification Results 
 In this section    , we report and analyse the results of our proposed tweet enrichment approach.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.UMLS ® terms are recognized and expanded with their synonyms.The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "Reference data set representation
 The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes    , cites    , uses and different types of content bibliographic data    , citation data    , usage data    , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 
Research data set
 The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus    , is still in its early stages of development.APPENDIX

Mean Average Precision.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.are not annotated with concepts from the UMLS    , however they are kept for logical formula conversion.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.PubChem has 23.98 vertices and 25.76 edges    , on average .BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.The data comprises comments scraped from the social news website reddit.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.To our surprise    , although gIndex is the oldest method among all representative graph indexing techniques we consider    , it performs the best for sparse datasets AIDS and PubChem since its pruning power is the best    , and thus    , the I/O cost is usually the lowest.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation

The University of Michigan intends to continue researching the use of OAI in a variety of ways.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.For example    , it is not meaningful to send the query " diabetes " to TripAdvisor .com    , a travel resource.Examples of such data include GDELT gdeltproject .org and Recorded Future www.recordedfuture.com.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains CUIs that arise from source ontologies     , which maintain hierarchical relationships between concepts.The assessor then searched the Blog06 test collection to see if blog posts with relevant opinions appear in the collection.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.Semantic Search Engine

 Introduction
Socially-curated websites such as Reddit depend on large communities for content creation and moderation 
The Reddit Controversy
 Reddit is the most popular exemplar 1 of a class of websites known as social content aggregators    , on which users can post new content as well as vote and comment on each other's content.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.An interesting feature of reddit    , is the 'throwaway account'.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in

In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .We preprocessed the OAIster collection to produce the bag-of-words representation as follows: Starting with the 668 repositories in the 9/2/2006 harvest    , we excluded 163 primarily non-English repositories    , and 117 small repositories containing fewer than 500 records    , leaving 388 repositories.When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors

 This paper presents the neighbourhood preserving quantization NPQ method for approximate similarity search.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.The current research focuses on the writing style participants use in English-language reviews of tourist attractions at TripAdvisor     , a site that prides itself on being international in scope    , operating in 34 countries.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.New York

Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.precision = P C

SCDA used UMLS to augment our symptoms field with their synonyms in both the query frame and our document frames.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.In second run    , we used only single terms exist in UMLS.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.In

Data Preprocessing -Content Extraction
Web pages are cluttered with distracting features around the body of a blog post which distract the user from the content block..We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.Notably    , they identify Reddit users as having a high propensity to move to alternate platforms.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.Such behavior of hiding consumer reviews has been reported several times in

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.Local    , as well as rating and review services such as TripAdvisor.Collaborative spatial data collection efforts     , such as OpenStreetMap 
OVERVIEW
Query Cases
There are five major categories of queries: i feature aggregation queries non-spatial queries    , for example    , queries for finding mean values of attributes or distribution of attributes; ii fundamental spatial queries    , including point based queries    , containment queries and spatial joins; iii complex spatial queries    , including spatial crossmatching or overlay large scale spatial join and nearest neighbor queries; iv integrated spatial and feature queries    , for example    , feature aggregation queries in a selected spatial regions; and v global spatial pattern queries    , for example    , queries on finding high density regions    , or queries to find directional patterns of spatial objects .The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.They can thus make the choice to dissociate from their reddit identity by simply using an alternate pseudonym and then leaving it behind.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Therefore    , we adopt the UMLS Metathesaurus to expand the concepts.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions

Examining the results in 
Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.These rankings reveal whether long-tail Reddit content is accessible on the alternative in its most popular commu- nities.The average blog entry in our BLOG06 index has 220 words.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.The feature semantic_jaccard is similarly defined by the Best RepLab system 
Metadata Features.Detection Evaluation Methodology 
The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS
For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 
WWW 
NDCGπ    , L@K = 1 GK L K X i=1 2 Lπ −1 i − 1 logi + 1 12 where Lπ −1 i
 is the relevance level of the document with rank i in π    , and GK L is a normalizing constant that ensures that a perfect ordering has an NDCG value of 1.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.We first extracted all of the UMLS terms that appeared in the query.Second    , posting is not affected by a confounding factor that commenting is subject to: Reddit influences commenting by how it presents potential targets for comments e.g.Procedure
For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.The resulting top concepts were converted to terms as in query expansion with UMLS Metathesaurus.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.This functionality is only possible if we have reliable    , consistent and appropriate subject metadata for each of the ten million records in OAIster.The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in 
DISCUSSION
 In order to gain more intuition on which cases TSA approach should be applied    , we provide real examples of the strengths and weaknesses of our methods compared to the state of the art ESA method.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.Next    , the chart parser is used to analyse the LDOCE definition of an 'ammeter'    , which is that it "is an instrument for measuring .We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users

Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.Word Sense Disambiguation System
The word sense disambiguation algorithm we developed is based on popular ideas from the literature 
In order to provide empirical knowledge for use by our WSD system we created a bootstrapped representation of the Brown1 document set which is part of the Semcor corpus.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age.The code is available at https://github.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.Reddit HWTF in particular displays a variety of features e.g.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.We then give details on the key Quora graph structures that connect different components together.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.Historic Newspaper Collection
The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.The weights of DNN are learned on ILSVRC-2010 1     , which is a subset of ImageNet 2 dataset with 1.26 million training images from 1  ,000 categories.All classes of UMLS concepts recognized by MetaMap were used.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++

This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.For example     , The New York Times and Chicago Tribune provide different viewpoints in their coverage of stories on health care and national defense.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.Despite the hysteria concerning a mass exodus from Reddit    , our behavior trend analysis shows that no such exodus occurred    , though a small user migration was apparent.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.This was achieved using publicly available database of medical terms called UMLS Metathesaurus.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.1. sim auto vs sim aviation vs real auto vs real aviation 2. auto sim auto + real auto vs aviation sim aviation + real aviation 3. simulated sim auto + sim aviation vs real real auto + real aviation We randomly split SRAA dataset such that 80% is used as training data and remaining is used as test data.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.Road network N1 is obtained from OpenStreetMap and contain all roads    , while road network N2 is obtained from the Beijing traffic management bureau and contains only highways and main roads.Maybe the synonyms in UMLS are not very relevant to this particular task.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.Multiple Formats 
Similarly    , a digital document may exist in different media types    , such as plain text    , HTML    , I&TEX    , DVI    , postscript    , scanned-image    , OCRed text    , or certain PC-a.pplication format.Impact on Voting
 Quora applies a voting system that leverages crowdsourced efforts to promote good answers.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.We find that positivity of feedback in Reddit    , the difference in upvotes and downvotes may play a substantial role    , as shown by the figure below.UMLS semantic network and Metathesaurus are extracted.D. Findings

Dataset
Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.The results of RankSVM    , RankBoost    , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.The dataset is available for research at https://github.System under Test 
The TPC-W Benchmark 
Web 
B.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.The UMLS Metathesaurus is used as the knowledge-base    , and we represent UMLS as a graph.Note that composite concept terms only appear in the UMLS ontology i.e.We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from 63  ,268 websites    , and ER from 20  ,754 websites.We can see that the performance on Blog-2008 is worse compared to Blog06 and Blog 07.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.To locate the URLs corresponding to news articles relevant to climate change    , we rely on GDELT themes and taxonomies    , which are topical tags that automatically annotate events.However    , surprisingly    , we found that using a single expansion term achieves the best performance on the RepLab 2014 test collection.Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.4 This NIST policy was not made public at development time    , but we had chosen to create our own internal blog question test set from BLOG06 snippets that can serve as answers.As an example of a simple system    , we could cite BDBComp Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Computação 
In existing systems    , in general    , such configurations are performed manually or via command-line scripts.The SRAA corpus contains 73  ,218 UseNet articles from four discussion groups: simulated auto racing    , simulated aviation    , real autos    , and real aviation.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.The quality of Reddit article is estimated as: 
Q i = λ sub · e qi · r up i − r down i  3 
We include the subscript in the λ sub term to emphasize that this constant is different across subreddits.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.Craigslist.They start out with a high comment-to-submission ratio relative to users in their cohort who abandon Reddit more quickly.We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.We select the check-in occurred during January 2010 to September 2010 from the original Brightkite

The second example illustrates how distributing a dataset allows one to achieve a particular task    , while minimizing the disclosure of sensitive information.term InChI=1S/C5H8O/c1-2-4-6-5- 3-1/h2  ,4H  ,1  ,3  ,5H2 
cannot be found because the responsible entity in the original document could not be matched uniquely to the PubChem entities.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.Medical domain knowledge is developed by several different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System UMLS.Types of relations that SemRep identifies is pre-defined by the UMLS.MetaMap was applied for the identification of UMLS concepts in visits.SemEval 2007 Web People Search Results
 The best system in SemEval 2007 obtained an Fscore of 0.78    , the average F-score of all 16 participant systems is 0.60.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.For all runs    , FOLDOC was used in the query analysis process for query expansion.Estimation Accuracy: We compare our CLA size estimators with a systematic excerpt 
End-to-End Experiments
 To study end-to-end CLA benefits    , we ran several algorithms over subsets of Mnist480m and ImageNet.We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.Additional Information from UMLS 
Besides supplying CUIs for identifying synonyms of terms    , the UMLS Metathesaurus provides other information that can be used when preparing sets of query terms.We run experiments for several choices of V : parts-of-speech    , the 100 most frequent words in Reddit    , and the 500 most frequent words in Reddit.For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.The UMLS only includes " ImmunoPrecipitation " and " Immune Precipitation " .The better results between the two runs are shown in 
Comparisons among performance on different datasets
In Table 13    , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06    , 07    , and 08.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.Experimental results    , obtained using the LETOR benchmark    , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.The source code is available at the official Github repository .In the reddit dataset    , the responder in each IAmA is a single notable personality with average reply rate of around 10.16%.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Results for the analysis of the 2  ,404 OAIster query strings are given in Tables 4 and 5 below.Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.20mg while the remaining half were medical terms that are not in UMLS.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.Stack 
Overflow.Weights of report concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.Results

The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.While this method has some advantages    , it still doesn't yield ground truth quality data for Reddit or Hacker News because the recruited population is unlikely to match the relevant population of users on Hacker News or Reddit.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS
Comparison of NDCG-Annealing Algorithm with Baselines in LETOR 3.0
We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0.His visual fields are intact.From those terms    , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.To address this problem we used the PubChem SQL dump to store all entity data in a file based hash map.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.We leave the smaller leaf intact.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.We also explored several query expansion strategies based on the UMLS metathesaurus.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We implemented our TSA approach using the New York Times archive 1863-2004.Dataset 
OpenStreetMap.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.F.

 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.that must have her mark intact.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.We used GDELT http://gdeltproject.org/ news dataset for our experiments.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.MetaMap only identifies UMLS concepts    , which are then mapped to SNOMED CT concepts.Interestingly    , CMU    , the top performing group    , experimented with both types of index    , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.Ensemble of Classifiers
The winner of the KDDCUP 2005 competition found that the best result was achieved by combining the exact matching method and SVM.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .The Ionosphere data set analysis the quality of a radar returns from ionosphere.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.The goal is to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of the UMLS Metathesaurus based query translation strategies .We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.Baselines: We compare our approach with two different baselines from RepLab 2014.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.Both Reddit and Hacker News display the current score of articles    , and thus provide a signal about how other users evaluated these articles.Some services incur either 271

  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.In comparison    , Reddit HWTF    , MTurkGrind    , and MTurk- Forum appear to be mostly dedicated to discussions about details of MTurk work.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.By collecting bread crumbs from cell phones    , social media    , and participatory platforms    , researchers will increasingly rely on data sets orders of magnitude richer than previous urban studies data sets 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank OpenStreetMap and all its contributors for making their data freely available.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.These facts in their logical forms denoted as F UMLS  and rules denoted as R UMLS  are used to infer relations between two terms.The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.OAIster can be found online at http://www.oaister.org/    , with over a million records available from over 140 institutions.Likewise    , a third score is computed based on the categories of TripAdvisor UT .WikiWars.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.This pipeline is based on Lavrenko's relevance models 
Query and Document Expansion with UMLS
 We also experimented with several approaches to query and document expansion using UMLS.WWW 2010  Full Paper April 26-30  Raleigh  NC  USA 
 We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including 
b    , we can see that different categories of locations are roughly differentiated by our similarity metric    , while under the baseline metric some of them are coupled together.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.The remaining words ill LDOCE is expected to be defined ill the next defining cycle.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.In the Reddit dataset    , the median article received 38 votes upvotes plus downvotes    , while the median Hacker News article received 21 votes    , with a minimum of 3 votes in each case.Our hypothesis is that performance will improve by expanding queries using synonyms from UMLS.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data    , a restaurant guide    , etc.We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor

 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.Surveys were first posted publicly to communities on Reddit    , Voat    , Hubski    , Empeopled    , Snapzu    , Stacksity    , Piroot    , HackerNews    , Linkibl    , SaidWho and Qetzl.MatchedAnswer – The frequency of the matched UMLS semantic categories.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.Performance on OpenStreetMap Dataset
Scalability of Hadoop-GIS
Boundary Handling Overhead
We run the join query on PI dataset to measure the overhead in boundary handling step.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.also the first query of the 'user' block in 
Publishing OpenStreetMap Geo Data
In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed    , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.For Part B    , we filtered out the CHEM group for the UMLS concept text but not from the UMLS CUIs.Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE

 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.THE BDBCOMP ARCHITECTURE
The BDBComp architecture comprises three major layers 
THE BDBCOMP REPOSITORY
The BDBComp main repository is a relational database and has been implemented in MySQL according to the ER schema depicted in 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 I.In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.The forum component of reddit is extremely active: popular posts often have well into 1000's of user comments .We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor    , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.a free-text inverted index and several UMLS CUI indexes.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.  , mediaeval history.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .UMLS provides a hierarchy between concepts through several relations including narrower than    , synonymous to    , and others.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.TDT corpora 
Results.Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.  , |{d ∈ Dn|appearsc    , d}| |Dn|

In the experiments described in this paper we used New York Times articles since 1870 for history.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario    , e.g.Thus    , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line    , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.As our training corpus we opted for two available resources: SemCor and OMSTI.For blog distillation    , the Blog06 corpus contains around 100k blogs    , and is a Web-like setting with anchor text    , linkage    , spam    , etc.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.To be considered non-rare    , a word needed to have occurred in SemCor at least once i.e.Reddit http://reddit.Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.  dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20    , selected using LocusLink information.Analysis on Model Dynamics
This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.Third    , the way that comments are presented on Reddit makes scraping the complete commenting history rather difficult.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC 
Evaluation Measures
TDT project has its own evaluation plan.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.Figure 2: Images from Pinterest collections by a Police department and an image uploaded to a wedding pinboard.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.As a result    , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases    , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.Her own practice in her office with digital material was almost entirely of on-screen reading from her laptop; mostly of digital journals    , but also of online scans of mediaeval material.Next    , we generate the XML format for our annotated corpus    , which is similar to the data format in SemEval-10 Task 10.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.Answers and StackOverflow    , the Reddit dataset offers following unique advantages.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.A Case Study
To further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed CRTER model    , out of the 550 test topics used in our experiments    , we conduct a case study on topic 867 on the Blog06 collection.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.For the purposes of the MESUR project    , a network-based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it.848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.By way of this feature    , reddit enables an individual create accounts in a matter of minutes without giving out an email address.We recruited via Reddit 5  more than 2000 volunteers to install our extension.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.This approach is taken in the PubChem Compound Database http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for users to search similar graphs for a given query graph.The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.The tool that transforms OAIster metadata from Simple Dublin Core to our native DLXS Bibliographic Class was modified so that it could ingest the file from the first step    , and output a transformed metadata record.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.Aleph is unable to find a good clause even after evaluating the maximum 500K clauses    , thus resulting in relatively worse performance on the WebKB-Department task than the WebKB-Student task.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.We filter the Concepts based on information we have available from the UMLS.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics    , calculates them for the established reference data set    , and assesses their validity and reliability.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.Consider a news website such as New York Times.An example of an Affiliation state context is diagrammed in 
Affiliation 
The Metric Context
The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.However    , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data    , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.In the end    , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.Reddit is also a home of subreddits like: ELIF Explain like I'm five    , TIL Today I learnt    , AMAAsk Me Anything etc.UMLS is an ontology of mostly medical terms called atoms.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.Technorati.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.PubChem consists of 1 million graphs and is a subset of the PubChem chemical structure database 4 .Word similarity judgment For similarity judgment correlations    , we selected two existing benchmarks that have the largest vocabulary overlap with our data: MEN 3K 
Single-word image retrieval 
 In order to visualize the acquired meaning for individual words    , we use images from the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet 
Sentence structure
In the following experiments    , we examine the knowledge of sentence structure learned by IMAG- INET    , and its impact on the model performance on image and paraphrase retrieval.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings

INCREMENTAL STORY CLUSTERING
Note the daily crawled data could be treated as a data stream.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.Section 5 describes how the UMLS can be applied to semantic matching.The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.For example    , travel sites such as TripAdvisor and TravellersPoint offer services that enable users to find hotels with particular facilities and located in particular regions.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.For each post    , Reddit provides the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.Many alternatives to Reddit saw a substantial increase in their relative post and comment volumes; however    , the volume on Reddit was largely unchanged    , indicating that the events had minimal effect on Reddit itself.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .By mapping these communities     , when a user posts to an alternative    , we can identify how popular the corresponding subreddit would be on Reddit .2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.TDT has been more and more important.  , the best RepLab 2013 systems.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.Collaborating with other projects that could benefit from using OAIster    , e.g.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site 
User lifespan.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.The corresponding UMLS concepts were added as a case feature.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.However    , given that we are interested in the peak in the coverage    , rather than in the number of events    , here we directly use the news articles    , not the events automatically mapped by GDELT; applying a consistent methodology for detecting events.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.What we learned from this study is that we should carefully use GDELT and ER for research because the two datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news sources.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.Second    , we mapped the concepts to their SNOMED-CT equivalents using the UMLS Meta-thesaurus.Three of the most accessible were the Merriam-Webster Pock& Dictionary MPD    , its larger sibling    , the Merriam-Webster Seventh Colegiate ~7 and the Longman Di@ionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.Currently    , the scholarly community has one primary means of understanding the value of a journal and thus its authors: the ISI Impact Factor

Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.The

LDOCE.This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project    , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time    , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.Moreover    , NLP tools for utilizing the information from UMLS have been developed.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.GitHub Watchers.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents    , learned contemporary works    , articles from journals    , etc.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.The similarity of two graphs is defined as the Tanimoto score of their fingerprints in PubChem.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent    , mesur:Document    , and mesur:Context 7 .  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets

THE MESUR ONTOLOGY
The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur.WWW2004    , 
Previous Work
Whereas search engines locate relevant documents in response to a query    , web-based Question Answering QA systems such as Mulder 
KNOWITALL was inspired    , in part    , by the WebKB project 
KNOWITALL
 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.UMLS Term Labeling
Building on the work of Nadkarni    , we also identified terms from the Universal Medical Language System UMLS that appeared in the reports.Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.In certain cases    , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form    , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.To help assess generality    , we have begun to study OpenStreetMap    , a significantly different community.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.To compare users' behavior on Reddit with that on the alternative platforms     , we leverage the fact that many alternatives feature subreddits with direct analogs to those seen on Reddit    , e.g.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.Status    , in both in the Reddit community as well as the RAOP subcommunity    , turns out to be strongly correlated with success.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.This research reveals how social media like reddit are fulfilling unique information and social needs of a cohort challenged with a stigmatic health concern looking through the lenses of disclosure    , social support    , and disinhibition.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.Evaluation
To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.EXPERIMENTS
Data Sets and Distance Functions
 We employ three image data sets: CoPhIR    , SIFT    , ImageNet     , and several data sets created from textual data.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.Conclusion
 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.Given a pair of UMLS concepts    , YTEX can produce knowledge based and distributional based similarity measures.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.
