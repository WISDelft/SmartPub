This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.The SRAA corpus contains 73  ,218 UseNet articles from four discussion groups: simulated auto racing    , simulated aviation    , real autos    , and real aviation.In the case of SRAA dataset we inferred 8 topics on the training data and labeled these 8 topics for all the three classification tasks discussed above.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.Besides    , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference    , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap.  , OpenStreetMap is about 300 GB.As a result    , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.A novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies 
THE MESUR ONTOLOGY
The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur.The Shi3ld-LDP prototype with internal SPARQL endpoint embeds the KGRAM/Corese 26 engine

.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.For SRAA dataset we learnt 10 topics on the complete dataset and labeled these 10 topics for all the three classification tasks.It is likely that monitoring all items for sale at Walmart    , say    , is not of interest.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent    , mesur:Document    , and mesur:Context 7 .  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.1. sim auto vs sim aviation vs real auto vs real aviation 2. auto sim auto + real auto vs aviation sim aviation + real aviation 3. simulated sim auto + sim aviation vs real real auto + real aviation We randomly split SRAA dataset such that 80% is used as training data and remaining is used as test data.OpenStreetMap.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus    , is still in its early stages of development.We filter out the photos that are not located in the city by latitude and longitude boundary as shown in

OVERVIEW
Query Cases
There are five major categories of queries: i feature aggregation queries non-spatial queries    , for example    , queries for finding mean values of attributes or distribution of attributes; ii fundamental spatial queries    , including point based queries    , containment queries and spatial joins; iii complex spatial queries    , including spatial crossmatching or overlay large scale spatial join and nearest neighbor queries; iv integrated spatial and feature queries    , for example    , feature aggregation queries in a selected spatial regions; and v global spatial pattern queries    , for example    , queries on finding high density regions    , or queries to find directional patterns of spatial objects .For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.In certain cases    , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form    , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.In particular    , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.To describe those segments    , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario    , e.g.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing.OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project    , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time    , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics    , calculates them for the established reference data set    , and assesses their validity and reliability.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.As an example of a simple system    , we could cite BDBComp Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Computação 
In existing systems    , in general    , such configurations are performed manually or via command-line scripts.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .The query thus defines a modified Location-Dependent Skyline Query as formulated by

The generated query with a runtime of 42 ms now contains a WITHIN preference for a polygon defining the administrative boundary of the 'Fatih' district as retrieved from the integrated OpenStreetMap data.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.Data Source

Figure 1: Overview of MESUR project phases.This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events.By collecting bread crumbs from cell phones    , social media    , and participatory platforms    , researchers will increasingly rely on data sets orders of magnitude richer than previous urban studies data sets 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank OpenStreetMap and all its contributors for making their data freely available.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.For SRAA dataset we infer 8 topics on the training dataset and label these 8 topics for all the three classification tasks.In BDBComp see 
Effectiveness Without Any Training
To analyze the effectiveness of our method without using any training example    , we execute NC with default eters i.e.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events    , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.This realization has led various retail giants such as WalMart

Boundary Handling Overhead
We run the join query on PI dataset to measure the overhead in boundary handling step.Location is based on GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application    , and the map is based on data from the OpenStreetMap project.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data    , a restaurant guide    , etc.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.However    , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen    , available as Shapefiles 10 .Road network N1 is obtained from OpenStreetMap and contain all roads    , while road network N2 is obtained from the Beijing traffic management bureau and contains only highways and main roads.Section 2 describes the size    , origin    , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data    , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.Currently    , the scholarly community has one primary means of understanding the value of a journal and thus its authors: the ISI Impact Factor 
LEVERAGING RELATIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY
 The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data.Therefore    , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .For the purposes of the MESUR project    , a network-based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.Data Sets
