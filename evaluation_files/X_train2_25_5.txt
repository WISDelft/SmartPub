For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.The two metrics are as follows: 
Experimental Results
Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.We leave the smaller leaf intact.Interestingly    , the most popular forum among U. S. workers is Reddit HWTF while international workers are most likely to use MTurkForum.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.The forum component of reddit is extremely active: popular posts often have well into 1000's of user comments .100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .On Reddit    , users employ subreddits to discuss everything from crochet to conspiracy theories.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.Evaluation
Ideally we would like to evaluate our quality estimates against some ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.The overall average gap is 749 days since 2008    , when users on Reddit were first allowed to create their own communities.In contrast    , tourists exhibit a sudden burst in activity on Reddit alternatives and then no further activity there.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.For WebKB dataset we learnt 10 topics.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.In the Reddit dataset    , the median article received 38 votes upvotes plus downvotes    , while the median Hacker News article received 21 votes    , with a minimum of 3 votes in each case.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.APPENDIX
Full-life view for users in Reddit.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.RELATED WORK
Stack Overflow is a collaborative question answering Stack Exchange website.Finally    , dual citizens have activity on alternatives that was sustained for longer than one week    , but their activity is not consistently higher on alternatives than Reddit.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.While this method has some advantages    , it still doesn't yield ground truth quality data for Reddit or Hacker News because the recruited population is unlikely to match the relevant population of users on Hacker News or Reddit.We also used private messaging PM features on Reddit and Voat to solicit participation from randomly-selected users.In this paper    , we construct a dataset from Reddit and present the first large-scale study on the coexistence of highly related communities.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.This research reveals how social media like reddit are fulfilling unique information and social needs of a cohort challenged with a stigmatic health concern looking through the lenses of disclosure    , social support    , and disinhibition.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains âˆ¼240k sentences .Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.Conclusion 
We have presented    , to the best of our knowledge    , the first comprehensive study of mental health discourse on the social media reddit.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.The annotators unified their schemes by consensus into a hierarchical scheme with 6 coarse-grained and 31 fine-grained motivational factors additional details available at networkdynamics.org/pubs/2016/reddit-exodus/.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.Since we lack the ability to evaluate against ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News    , we evaluate this model on data from the MusicLab experiment.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.recommender systems 
JESTER 1.0
The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Ensemble of Classifiers
The winner of the KDDCUP 2005 competition found that the best result was achieved by combining the exact matching method and SVM.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.Thus both clusters are left intact.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.Present scale and span
 So far    , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties    , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events    , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.These rankings reveal whether long-tail Reddit content is accessible on the alternative in its most popular commu- nities.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .Reddit and each of the remaining 21 alternative platforms were crawled for all publicly available content.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Reddit HWTF in particular displays a variety of features e.g.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.While discerning ironic comments on reddit is our immediate task    , the proposed approach is generally applicable to a wide-range of subjective     , web-based text classification tasks.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.Reddit is also a home of subreddits like: ELIF Explain like I'm five    , TIL Today I learnt    , AMAAsk Me Anything etc.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.Xanga.Reddit allows for threaded conversations    , where users can comment over other comments.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.Differences in Social Support 
Does the nature of feedback or social support from the greater reddit community also differ in the case of posts from anonymous accounts  ?We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.They start out with a high comment-to-submission ratio relative to users in their cohort who abandon Reddit more quickly.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.We find that positivity of feedback in Reddit    , the difference in upvotes and downvotes may play a substantial role    , as shown by the figure below.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.An example of an Affiliation state context is diagrammed in

The Metric Context
The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g.His visual fields are intact.We recruited via Reddit 5  more than 2000 volunteers to install our extension.  , by ranking them    , or featuring targets on the Reddit home page.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.However we cannot directly estimate the probability of receiving a vote versus not receiving a vote    , for both Reddit and Hacker News.length on FBIS.In certain cases    , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form    , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.Status    , in both in the Reddit community as well as the RAOP subcommunity    , turns out to be strongly correlated with success.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; â€“ the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.A novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies 
THE MESUR ONTOLOGY
The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the 
 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.Pinterest
Pinterest is a pinboard-style image sharing social network    , where everything is about photos and videos.The Ionosphere data set analysis the quality of a radar returns from ionosphere.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Stack 
Overflow.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.Third    , the way that comments are presented on Reddit makes scraping the complete commenting history rather difficult.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.Results

SIGIR 2007 Proceedings 
The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.This work is a preliminary exploration    , focusing on a set of high precision reddit communities    , however expanding to other subreddits is a ripe area of future research.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.The results are shown in 
Reddit and Hacker News
Given that our model effectively recovers ground truth data from the MusicLab experiment    , we now evaluate the fit of the Poisson model to Reddit and Hacker News voting data.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics    , calculates them for the established reference data set    , and assesses their validity and reliability.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.The What block of 
CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.We find this method is effective at recovering ground truth quality parameters     , and further show that it provides a good fit for Reddit and Hacker News data.We take migration to be a substantial shift in activity    , wherein the user's smoothed activity is higher on alternatives than on Reddit for at least two weeks.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.Currently    , the scholarly community has one primary means of understanding the value of a journal and thus its authors: the ISI Impact Factor 
LEVERAGING RELATIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY
 The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.One might conjecture either that MTurkGrind has developed into an independent    , more socialized community partly from a pool of Reddit HWTF users    , or that MTurk- Grind has started to attract users from Reddit HWTF who seek more social interactions.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .Therefore     , the MESUR owl:ObjectProperty taxonomy provides two types of object properties: ContextProperty and InferredProperty see 
Publishes hasGroup: Group 
.1 
Event hasSink: Agent or Document 
.1 
State hasAffiliator: Organization 
Figure 10: Classes of Context and their properties 
The Context class has two subclasses: Event and State.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.Both Reddit and Hacker News display the current score of articles    , and thus provide a signal about how other users evaluated these articles.WikiWars.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.Reddit Reddit is composed of many different subcommunities called " subreddits " .Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.Despite the hysteria concerning a mass exodus from Reddit    , our behavior trend analysis shows that no such exodus occurred    , though a small user migration was apparent.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus    , is still in its early stages of development.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.We define a video to be " discovered " on Reddit if it's score was in the top 10% of scores of posts to r/videos in 2012.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project    , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time    , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.The rest of the order was preserved intact.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.For each post    , Reddit provides the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.that must have her mark intact.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB

 Introduction
Socially-curated websites such as Reddit depend on large communities for content creation and moderation 
The Reddit Controversy
 Reddit is the most popular exemplar 1 of a class of websites known as social content aggregators    , on which users can post new content as well as vote and comment on each other's content.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.Surveys were first posted publicly to communities on Reddit    , Voat    , Hubski    , Empeopled    , Snapzu    , Stacksity    , Piroot    , HackerNews    , Linkibl    , SaidWho and Qetzl.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.Note also that a musical time-scaling Ïƒ    , Ïƒ âˆˆ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.Section 2 describes the size    , origin    , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.Experiments
Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work

Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.On Reddit    , over half of articles were discarded because they appeared for less than an hour in the range of positions studied.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book;

Experimental results on FBIS corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and our lexicalized reordering model.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.Various celebrities and noteworthy personalities have used reddit as a means to interact with Internet users    , such conversations fall under the Ask-Me-Anything and its variant subreddits.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over â‰ˆ5 years and conduct a characterization study.14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.For all runs    , FOLDOC was used in the query analysis process for query expansion.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.In comparison    , Reddit HWTF    , MTurkGrind    , and MTurk- Forum appear to be mostly dedicated to discussions about details of MTurk work.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.To compare users' behavior on Reddit with that on the alternative platforms     , we leverage the fact that many alternatives feature subreddits with direct analogs to those seen on Reddit    , e.g.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.Therefore    , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.By way of this feature    , reddit enables an individual create accounts in a matter of minutes without giving out an email address.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.For the purposes of the MESUR project    , a network-based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.The other two AMA's are open to a more wider audience for sharing their life events and allowing other reddit users to ask questions related to those events.This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events    , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.We are encouraged by our method's ability to recover ground truth from the MusicLab experiment but we recognize that although Reddit and Hacker News are similar in some ways    , they are fundamentally different.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.Aleph is unable to find a good clause even after evaluating the maximum 500K clauses    , thus resulting in relatively worse performance on the WebKB-Department task than the WebKB-Student task.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.As a result    , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.Answers and StackOverflow    , the Reddit dataset offers following unique advantages.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.They can thus make the choice to dissociate from their reddit identity by simply using an alternate pseudonym and then leaving it behind.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.By mapping these communities     , when a user posts to an alternative    , we can identify how popular the corresponding subreddit would be on Reddit .They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.aggregation ingestion

 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.Second    , posting is not affected by a confounding factor that commenting is subject to: Reddit influences commenting by how it presents potential targets for comments e.g.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events.For example    , Reddit    , a famous social news site    , has mentioned in its official blog post 2 that this method is used for their ranking of comments.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.  , Pinterest by ind resp.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.If q = âˆ’1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.We run experiments for several choices of V : parts-of-speech    , the 100 most frequent words in Reddit    , and the 500 most frequent words in Reddit.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.We further augment the dictionary with terms of interest that are not present in FOLDOC    , in particular    , topics addressed by W3C standards.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.Notably    , they identify Reddit users as having a high propensity to move to alternate platforms.The dataset in 
Characterizing affixes 
The goal of this section is to explore the types of canonical affixes users on Reddit utilize.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.Xanga treats email addresses differently: users can provide their email address to Xanga    , and visitors can use the website to send email    , without the address being visible directly.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent    , mesur:Document    , and mesur:Context 7 .The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .Dataset Description

Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.The data comprises comments scraped from the social news website reddit.In the reddit dataset    , the responder in each IAmA is a single notable personality with average reply rate of around 10.16%.Reference data set representation
 The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes    , cites    , uses and different types of content bibliographic data    , citation data    , usage data    , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 
Research data set
 The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.Our principal argument is that simple bag-of-words based text classification models â€“ which    , when coupled with sufficient data    , have proven to be extremely successful for many natural language processing tasks

Quora.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.Later    , in Â§5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.The quality of Reddit article is estimated as: 
Q i = Î» sub Â· e qi Â· r up i âˆ’ r down i  3 
We include the subscript in the Î» sub term to emphasize that this constant is different across subreddits.pins for majority to appear

We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.An interesting feature of reddit    , is the 'throwaway account'.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.
