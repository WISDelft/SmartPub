To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.The Shi3ld-LDP prototype with internal SPARQL endpoint embeds the KGRAM/Corese 26 engine 
Billion Triple Challenge 2012 Dataset 27 
.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.We leave the smaller leaf intact.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .Furthermore    , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.Data Description
We used the Letor 2 data collection 
Evaluation Measures
 In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms     , three evaluation measures are applied: Precision    , Mean average precision and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain 
18 
Mean Average Precision.The dataset is available for research at https://github.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.RELATED WORK
Stack Overflow is a collaborative question answering Stack Exchange website.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.The results of RankSVM    , RankBoost    , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in 
Loading and preprocessing 
 the ontology.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.Thus both clusters are left intact.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.Present scale and span
 So far    , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties    , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events    , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.Technorati.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics..Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.bl1  ,bl2  ,.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.,b1n .The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com 
¯ F x = 1 − F x = P X > x 
on log-log axes.Xanga.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.The process is sketched in

 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection 
One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.His visual fields are intact.An example of an Affiliation state context is diagrammed in

The Metric Context
The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.In certain cases    , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form    , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.A novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies 
THE MESUR ONTOLOGY
The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur.Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.Stack 
Overflow.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.The source code is available at the official Github repository .Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics    , calculates them for the established reference data set    , and assesses their validity and reliability.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     , 
where sgt is the word embedding vector of term t learned by the SkipGram algorithm 
bm d tq = arg max t d ∈d simtq    , t d  bmqt d  = arg max tq ∈q simtq    , t d  δst    , d = simt    , bm d t 
δsq    , t = simbmqt    , t     , 4 Term repetition is avoided since the number of occurrences of the term t in d is already counted in fL i .These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.The What block of 
CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.Currently    , the scholarly community has one primary means of understanding the value of a journal and thus its authors: the ISI Impact Factor 
LEVERAGING RELATIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY
 The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.Therefore     , the MESUR owl:ObjectProperty taxonomy provides two types of object properties: ContextProperty and InferredProperty see

 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .WikiWars.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.Introduction

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus    , is still in its early stages of development.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project    , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time    , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.The rest of the order was preserved intact.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS

This work was funded in part by the EUSES Consortium via NSF ITR-0325273 and by NSF under Grants CCF-0438929 and CCF-0613823.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.on the Xanga dataset.f Xanga web-link categories

Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.Zhu    , Kraut    , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.Section 2 describes the size    , origin    , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work

To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.In addition to listing the citing articles    , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.Experimental results    , obtained using the LETOR benchmark    , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia

 Introduction
 The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population TAC-KBP Slot Filling SF task 
1 Supervised classification.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.GitHub Watchers.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.In our analysis of GitHub

Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.Therefore    , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.For the purposes of the MESUR project    , a network-based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events    , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.As a result    , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The code is available at https://github.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Lexvo 
Results and Discussion
 This paper presented preliminaries for the development of a generic OWL/DLbased formalism for the representation of linguistic corpora.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.aggregation ingestion

billion usage events
Figure 1: Overview of MESUR project phases.For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error

METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.D. Findings 
 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 
The Case Studies
 The my Grid project has developed a service-oriented architecture to enable bioinformaticians to: gather distributed data; use data and analysis tools presented as services; compose and enact workflows; and to manage the generated 
User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.  , Live Search    , Ask.com    , or AltaVista    , and contained either search engine result pages    , visits to search engine homepages    , or pages connected by a hyperlink trail to a search result page.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events.On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.If q = −1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.According to a recent survey made by Technorati 
RCS ARCHITECTURE
INCREMENTAL STORY CLUSTERING
Note the daily crawled data could be treated as a data stream.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Xanga treats email addresses differently: users can provide their email address to Xanga    , and visitors can use the website to send email    , without the address being visible directly.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent    , mesur:Document    , and mesur:Context 7 .Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.Dataset Description
Stack Overflow provides a periodic database dump of all user-generated content under the Creative Commons Attribute- ShareAlike 
Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources 
Tools and Services

Citebase Search
Citebase    , more fully described by Hitchcock et al.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.Reference data set representation
 The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes    , cites    , uses and different types of content bibliographic data    , citation data    , usage data    , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 
Research data set
 The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.
