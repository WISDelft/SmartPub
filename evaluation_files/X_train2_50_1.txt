Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.In 
Binding
Now    , given a query word wi    , we need to find the erroneous variants from the OCRed corpus.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     , 
where sgt is the word embedding vector of term t learned by the SkipGram algorithm 
bm d tq = arg max t d ∈d simtq    , t d  bmqt d  = arg max tq ∈q simtq    , t d  δst    , d = simt    , bm d t 
δsq    , t = simbmqt    , t     , 4 Term repetition is avoided since the number of occurrences of the term t in d is already counted in fL i .Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.The Mean Average Precision MAP results for HGT and NIPS are shown in 
SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.Introduction
Temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different SemEval tasks 
Related work
 The present work is closely related to previous approaches involved in TempEval campaigns 
TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering
In the SemEval task 4 TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering 
Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.GitHub Watchers.To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.Historic Newspaper Collection
The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.As future work    , we intend to evaluate the impact of the service in the expansion of BDBComp as well as on its sustainability.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink

 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.3 How would you grade your knowledge of bibliographic self-archiving after using the BDBComp service  ?Experiments

EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS

 is the relevance level of the document with rank i in π    , and GK L is a normalizing constant that ensures that a perfect ordering has an NDCG value of 1.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.In BDBComp see 
Effectiveness Without Any Training
To analyze the effectiveness of our method without using any training example    , we execute NC with default eters i.e.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

New York Times Articles N > 2 
We perform our approach on New York Times articles.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases    , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .Each scanned document was run through OCR; there are 646 documents whose OCRed text was hand-corrected.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Given the data types of the TPC-W benchmark    , we categorized these data types as shown in

Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .The other two measures are defined according to the standard measures to evaluate the performance of classification     , that is    , precision    , recall and F1-measure

An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.For example    , in the New York Times front page shown in 
Structural Analysis
Our structural analysis of an HTML document is based on the key observations mentioned above.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.Results

Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection

The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.,b1n .There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.Previous TDT research

In this formula    , z is the decay factor and constant' is the n-th harmonic number of order z.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method 
Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.During the parsing of the XML file    , the system calculates features for every word    , line    , paragraph    , and page of the OCRed text.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.length on FBIS.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.TDT corpora 
Results.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council

Mean Average Precision.Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.Harnessing Stack Overflow data

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 I.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.  , Pinterest by ind resp.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.The rest of the order was preserved intact.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.that must have her mark intact.According to a recent survey made by Technorati

We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states

Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI

PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.New York

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.The dataset is available for research at https://github.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.On the BDBComp collection    , SAND outperformed two unsupervised methods in more than 36% under the pF1 metric and in more 4% under the K metric.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark

LDOCE.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources 
Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times 
Related research is briefly discussed in Section 2.We leave the smaller leaf intact.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++

We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.precision = P C
Implementation
 The collection used in the experiments is part of TDT- 3 1 .We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.Agency Budget and New York Times News

CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.Orkut also offers friend relationship.recommender systems

This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset

We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.Discussion

The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.Detection Evaluation Methodology 
The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.  dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20    , selected using LocusLink information.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.with improbable movements and expr In the following part of this s&tion    , the comparison betwee~ semantic markers of LDOCE and the thesaurus constrn&ed ti:o~    , ~he definitions of nouns in LDOCE is discussed ikon~ ~;he view Nouns rdated to the concept animate have a relatively rumple st  ,nctnre in the thesaurus    , us auimat~ is often used ~s an example :d ~¢ the~uaar~_s.like system.4 Validation on new data sets    , such as the Jester data set

 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.BDBComp has been designed to be OAI compliant and adopts Dublin Core DC as its metadata standard.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.We use MERT

For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .More information about this dataset can be found in 
The 
The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.The source code is available at the official Github repository .It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.As an example of a simple system    , we could cite BDBComp Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Computação 
In existing systems    , in general    , such configurations are performed manually or via command-line scripts.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor

 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.2 Douban 5 book data

CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB 
Comparisons.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.ok200706301185791252056 "     , what you get is a profile which is built runtime by querying all the data sources on the web which are indexed by Sindice 5 .The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.Consider a news website such as New York Times.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia

We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.This is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times that includes the article title    , byline    , publication date    , and URL.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.Experiments
Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .Semantic Search Engine

 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .For each word    , we construct the time series of its occurrence in New York Times articles.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.Furthermore    , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Ellen Spertus for her assistance with the Orkut data    , and Tim Heilman for his assistance with generating datasets for semantic query similarity.Pinterest
Pinterest is a pinboard-style image sharing social network    , where everything is about photos and videos.To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.Quora and Stack Overflow

Stack Overflow is a collaborative question answering Stack Exchange website.Supplementary evaluations are described in the subsequent sections that include the comparison with SemEval-2 participating systems    , and the analysis of model dynamics with the experimental data.Thus both clusters are left intact.The data provided by AcroMed 4     , LocusLink 5     , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.Evaluation

 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.Aleph is unable to find a good clause even after evaluating the maximum 500K clauses    , thus resulting in relatively worse performance on the WebKB-Department task than the WebKB-Student task.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the

In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.Experimental results    , obtained using the LETOR benchmark    , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.Ensemble of Classifiers

Evaluation Measures
TDT project has its own evaluation plan.Main experiments
In Table 1    , the results of Siamese CBOW on 20 SemEval datasets are displayed    , together with the results of the baseline systems.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.bl1  ,bl2  ,.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.LabelMe 4 .Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.TDT has been more and more important.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.electric current."TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.WWW2004    , 
Previous Work
Whereas search engines locate relevant documents in response to a query    , web-based Question Answering QA systems such as Mulder 
KNOWITALL was inspired    , in part    , by the WebKB project 
KNOWITALL
 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Results

SIGIR 2007 Proceedings 
The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.  , features 7–12 in 
Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the 
 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.His visual fields are intact.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors 
Projection Methods
 We evaluate NPQ quantisation performance with five projection schemes: LSH-based projections 
Baselines
NPQ quantisation performance is compared against four state-of-the-art quantisation schemes in addition to the standard threshold at zero technique: single bit quantisation SBQ 
Evaluation Protocol
 In all experiments we follow previously accepted proce- dure

CONCLUSIONS
 This paper presents the neighbourhood preserving quantization NPQ method for approximate similarity search.On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.In our analysis of GitHub

Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained 
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns 
 4 Comparison between Result of Extraction and BOX Code 
The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site 
User lifespan.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.
