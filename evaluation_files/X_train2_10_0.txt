KNOWITALL
 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.Procedure
For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor    , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.Text Corpora

Sentiment Scoring 
On the hotel reviews    , we compute the root mean squared error of linear sentiment score regression trained using stochastic gradient descent SGD from Weka 3.7.5 
Effectiveness of Modeling Argumentation
First    , we measure the theoretically possible scoring effectiveness of all feature types within one domain.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in

 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality    , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user‐spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the  Rest of the spots sorting First of all    , we sort the probability of user interest of dislike for each category in ascending way.1 TripAdvisor is an ideal case study for us to explore the dynamics of language in a social medium characterized by the diversity of its participants and its huge scale    , yet that offers few opportunities for direct interaction or dialog between participants.Hotel Data
Data Description: We collected 4792 reviews about a well-known hotel brand from TripAdvisor.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.WWW 2010  Full Paper April 26-30  Raleigh  NC  USA 
 We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including 
b    , we can see that different categories of locations are roughly differentiated by our similarity metric    , while under the baseline metric some of them are coupled together.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com

on log-log axes.USER STUDY DETAILS
 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .TripAdvisor 2 for vacation trip planning    , and we assume that one such tool has been employed.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.Craigslist.JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Results
The average classification accuracies for the WebKB data set are shown in 
SIGIR 2007 Proceedings 
The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.The current research focuses on the writing style participants use in English-language reviews of tourist attractions at TripAdvisor     , a site that prides itself on being international in scope    , operating in 34 countries.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.TripAdvisor 
– .  , Live Search    , Ask.com    , or AltaVista    , and contained either search engine result pages    , visits to search engine homepages    , or pages connected by a hyperlink trail to a search result page.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.For the spots that are not found in TripAdvisor    , we will label them by hands.
