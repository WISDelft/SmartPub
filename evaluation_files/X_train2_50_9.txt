Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.We observe similar trends in Quora.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.In 
Binding
Now    , given a query word wi    , we need to find the erroneous variants from the OCRed corpus.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.TripAdvisor 2 for vacation trip planning    , and we assume that one such tool has been employed.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.1 We obtained 1  ,212  ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86  ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25  ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 .We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.Road network N1 is obtained from OpenStreetMap and contain all roads    , while road network N2 is obtained from the Beijing traffic management bureau and contains only highways and main roads.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.In the end    , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.The BLOG06 collection contains approximately 100k feed documents    , which are a mix of ATOM and RSS XML.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.However    , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen    , available as Shapefiles 10 .On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .What we learned from this study is that we should carefully use GDELT and ER for research because the two datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news sources.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.GitHub Watchers.Such behavior of hiding consumer reviews has been reported several times in

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.We find a significantly high correlation between the news geographies of ER and GDELT ρ=0.867    , p=1.896e-74.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.University of Amsterdam Team
Runids: UAmsTF30WU 
This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .also the first query of the 'user' block in 
Publishing OpenStreetMap Geo Data
In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed    , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.on the Xanga dataset.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Historic Newspaper Collection
The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.BRIGHTKITE.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink 
CONCEPT EXTRACTION.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.OpenStreetMap.Threats to Validity

Stability of Quora topics 
 In this section    , we shall perform stability analysis of the popular topics.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .By distributing tasks or questions to large numbers of Internet users    , these " crowd-sourcing " systems have done everything from answering user questions Quora    , to translating books    , creating 3-D photo tours

EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.For example    , it is not meaningful to send the query " diabetes " to TripAdvisor .com    , a travel resource.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was funded in part by the EUSES Consortium via NSF ITR-0325273 and by NSF under Grants CCF-0438929 and CCF-0613823.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.Each scanned document was run through OCR; there are 646 documents whose OCRed text was hand-corrected.Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .Given the data types of the TPC-W benchmark    , we categorized these data types as shown in 
Costs.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.The Shi3ld-LDP prototype with internal SPARQL endpoint embeds the KGRAM/Corese 26 engine 
Billion Triple Challenge 2012 Dataset 27 
.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.D. Findings 
 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.USER STUDY DETAILS
 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors     , such as location    , gender and age 6 .University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.To locate the URLs corresponding to news articles relevant to climate change    , we rely on GDELT themes and taxonomies    , which are topical tags that automatically annotate events.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.We use GDELT    , currently the largest global event catalog    , to automatically discover relevant events with high MSM coverage.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.Then    , we extract all the unique URLs corresponding to events annotated in GDELT with one of these themes for each day.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.f Xanga web-link categories

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.Location is based on GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application    , and the map is based on data from the OpenStreetMap project.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.Data
The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .During the parsing of the XML file    , the system calculates features for every word    , line    , paragraph    , and page of the OCRed text.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.length on FBIS.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.Introduction

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.TDT corpora 
Results.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.Besides    , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference    , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.The code is available at https://github.We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from 63  ,268 websites    , and ER from 20  ,754 websites.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.  , Pinterest by ind resp.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection    , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 
 INTRODUCTION
A large and increasing number of people are using Web search engine to seek information today.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection
Evaluation.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.According to a recent survey made by Technorati

As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.1 TripAdvisor is an ideal case study for us to explore the dynamics of language in a social medium characterized by the diversity of its participants and its huge scale    , yet that offers few opportunities for direct interaction or dialog between participants.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 
.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.WWW 2010  Full Paper April 26-30  Raleigh  NC  USA

PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.Examples of such data include GDELT gdeltproject .org and Recorded Future www.recordedfuture.com.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.However    , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.Xanga.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Dataset 
OpenStreetMap.The dataset is available for research at https://github.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times more documents than ER does per day.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental setup
TPC-W benchmark.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.discussing travel experiences in TripAdvisor.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.precision = P C
Implementation
 The collection used in the experiments is part of TDT- 3 1 .INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.7 GDELT covers a " cross-section of all major international    , national    , regional    , local    , and hyper-local news sources    , both print and broadcast    , from nearly every corner of the globe " 8 including major international news sources.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.In particular    , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.Performance on OpenStreetMap Dataset

Boundary Handling Overhead
We run the join query on PI dataset to measure the overhead in boundary handling step.For the spots that are not found in TripAdvisor    , we will label them by hands.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.Orkut also offers friend relationship.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.Hotel Data
Data Description: We collected 4792 reviews about a well-known hotel brand from TripAdvisor.GDELT releases data about daily media coverage in two formats: the Event Database and the Global Knowledge Graph GKG.The better results between the two runs are shown in 
Comparisons among performance on different datasets
In Table 13    , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06    , 07    , and 08.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.The query thus defines a modified Location-Dependent Skyline Query as formulated by 
❙ ❊ ▲ ❊ ❈ ❚ * ❋ ❘ ❖ ▼ accommodation P ❘ ❊ ❋ ❊ ❘ ❘ ■ ◆ ●  location ❲ ■ ❚ ❍ ■ ◆ ' KML ' ❆ ◆ ❉ location ◆ ❊ ❆ ❘ ❇ ❨ 28.98167     , 41.01111 P ❘ ■ ❖ ❘ ❚❖  number_rooms ❇ ❊ ❚ ❲ ❊ ❊ ◆ 1     , 50 ❆ ◆ ❉ customer_rating ▼ ❖ ❘ ❊ ❚ ❍ ❆ ◆ 3 ❆ ◆ ❉ amenities ❈ ❖ ◆ ❚ ❆ ■ ◆ ❙ ' bike rentals ' 
The generated query with a runtime of 42 ms now contains a WITHIN preference for a polygon defining the administrative boundary of the 'Fatih' district as retrieved from the integrated OpenStreetMap data.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor    , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.Discussion

 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.System under Test 
The TPC-W Benchmark 
Web 
B.For all runs    , FOLDOC was used in the query analysis process for query expansion.Multiple Formats 
Similarly    , a digital document may exist in different media types    , such as plain text    , HTML    , I&TEX    , DVI    , postscript    , scanned-image    , OCRed text    , or certain PC-a.pplication format.Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents.When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.WikiWars.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario    , e.g.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.Evaluation
To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.We used a version of the LocusLink database containing 128  ,580 entries.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data    , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.Local    , as well as rating and review services such as TripAdvisor.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.Technorati.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.From the TripAdvisor data    , we randomly sampled 650 threads.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.To help assess generality    , we have begun to study OpenStreetMap    , a significantly different community.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.The source code is available at the official Github repository .It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.We use the Comparison between GDELT and ER Scale One of the most important criteria for the comparison is the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehensive the dataset is.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.4 This NIST policy was not made public at development time    , but we had chosen to create our own internal blog question test set from BLOG06 snippets that can serve as answers.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.The average blog entry in our BLOG06 index has 220 words.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.Collaborative spatial data collection efforts     , such as OpenStreetMap 
OVERVIEW
Query Cases
There are five major categories of queries: i feature aggregation queries non-spatial queries    , for example    , queries for finding mean values of attributes or distribution of attributes; ii fundamental spatial queries    , including point based queries    , containment queries and spatial joins; iii complex spatial queries    , including spatial crossmatching or overlay large scale spatial join and nearest neighbor queries; iv integrated spatial and feature queries    , for example    , feature aggregation queries in a selected spatial regions; and v global spatial pattern queries    , for example    , queries on finding high density regions    , or queries to find directional patterns of spatial objects .In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .To describe those segments    , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users 
Dataset N K N GC k C D EF F D l 
Brightkite vides a public API to search and download these messages.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality     , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user-spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the personality of recommendation system.GDELT indexes documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average    , whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.TripAdvisor 
– .Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.For example    , travel sites such as TripAdvisor and TravellersPoint offer services that enable users to find hotels with particular facilities and located in particular regions.OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .Experiments

 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality    , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user‐spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the  Rest of the spots sorting First of all    , we sort the probability of user interest of dislike for each category in ascending way.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems

CONCLUSIONS
We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.However    , given that we are interested in the peak in the coverage    , rather than in the number of events    , here we directly use the news articles    , not the events automatically mapped by GDELT; applying a consistent methodology for detecting events.Impact on Voting

IX.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data    , a restaurant guide    , etc.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.While the definition of blog distillation as explained above is different    , the idea is to provide the users with the key blogs about 
Topics and Relevance Judgments
 For the purposes of the blog distillation task    , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC

Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.LabelMe 4 .Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan

GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.TDT has been more and more important.GDELT contains a set of entities for each article ; however    , we ignored these annotations and solely relied on our own methods to extract and disambiguate entities.The other dataset contains 200 reviews randomly selected from Tripadvisor.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com

on log-log axes.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 
The Case Studies
 The my Grid project has developed a service-oriented architecture to enable bioinformaticians to: gather distributed data; use data and analysis tools presented as services; compose and enact workflows; and to manage the generated 
User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors 
Projection Methods
 We evaluate NPQ quantisation performance with five projection schemes: LSH-based projections 
Baselines
NPQ quantisation performance is compared against four state-of-the-art quantisation schemes in addition to the standard threshold at zero technique: single bit quantisation SBQ 
Evaluation Protocol
 In all experiments we follow previously accepted proce- dure

Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.We filter out the photos that are not located in the city by latitude and longitude boundary as shown in 
Evaluation Measure
We extract a set of tourist attractions in the metadata of OpenStreetMap.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.The assessor then searched the Blog06 test collection to see if blog posts with relevant opinions appear in the collection.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.  , OpenStreetMap is about 300 GB.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.OpenStreetMap OSM.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
