 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?The WikiWars corpus

CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality     , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user-spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the personality of recommendation system.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.Furthermore    , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.REFERENCES
 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors     , such as location    , gender and age 6 .However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.Such behavior of hiding consumer reviews has been reported several times in

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor    , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.Text Corpora 
On the one hand    , we process the ArguAna TripAdvisor corpus that we have introduced in 
Sentiment Scoring 
On the hotel reviews    , we compute the root mean squared error of linear sentiment score regression trained using stochastic gradient descent SGD from Weka 3.7.5 
Effectiveness of Modeling Argumentation
First    , we measure the theoretically possible scoring effectiveness of all feature types within one domain.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.From the TripAdvisor data    , we randomly sampled 650 threads.Likewise    , a third score is computed based on the categories of TripAdvisor UT .Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.For example    , travel sites such as TripAdvisor and TravellersPoint offer services that enable users to find hotels with particular facilities and located in particular regions.For example    , it is not meaningful to send the query " diabetes " to TripAdvisor .com    , a travel resource.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.The other dataset contains 200 reviews randomly selected from Tripadvisor.1 We obtained 1  ,212  ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86  ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25  ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 .a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality    , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user‐spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the  Rest of the spots sorting First of all    , we sort the probability of user interest of dislike for each category in ascending way.1 TripAdvisor is an ideal case study for us to explore the dynamics of language in a social medium characterized by the diversity of its participants and its huge scale    , yet that offers few opportunities for direct interaction or dialog between participants.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

System Model
In this section    , we present the operational features of ONYX.Hotel Data
Data Description: We collected 4792 reviews about a well-known hotel brand from TripAdvisor.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.WikiWars.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.WWW 2010  Full Paper April 26-30  Raleigh  NC  USA 
 We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including 
b    , we can see that different categories of locations are roughly differentiated by our similarity metric    , while under the baseline metric some of them are coupled together.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.USER STUDY DETAILS
 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.TripAdvisor 2 for vacation trip planning    , and we assume that one such tool has been employed.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.The current research focuses on the writing style participants use in English-language reviews of tourist attractions at TripAdvisor     , a site that prides itself on being international in scope    , operating in 34 countries.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .TripAdvisor 
– .For the spots that are not found in TripAdvisor    , we will label them by hands.
