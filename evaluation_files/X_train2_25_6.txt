B.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.The assessor then searched the Blog06 test collection to see if blog posts with relevant opinions appear in the collection.The two metrics are as follows: 
Experimental Results
Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.time

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
We tested SugarCube on the Blog06 collection 
CONCLUSIONS
We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube.A Case Study
To further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed CRTER model    , out of the 550 test topics used in our experiments    , we conduct a case study on topic 867 on the Blog06 collection.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.Detection Evaluation Methodology 
The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.TDT has been more and more important.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.For each word    , we construct the time series of its occurrence in New York Times articles.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .However    , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.Data Description
We used the Letor 2 data collection 
Evaluation Measures
 In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms     , three evaluation measures are applied: Precision    , Mean average precision and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain 
18 
Mean Average Precision.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.  , Walmart.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.RELATED WORK
Stack Overflow is a collaborative question answering Stack Exchange website.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.While the definition of blog distillation as explained above is different    , the idea is to provide the users with the key blogs about 
Topics and Relevance Judgments
 For the purposes of the blog distillation task    , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.The results of RankSVM    , RankBoost    , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.with improbable movements and expr In the following part of this s&tion    , the comparison betwee~ semantic markers of LDOCE and the thesaurus constrn&ed ti:o~    , ~he definitions of nouns in LDOCE is discussed ikon~ ~;he view Nouns rdated to the concept animate have a relatively rumple st  ,nctnre in the thesaurus    , us auimat~ is often used ~s an example :d ~¢ the~uaar~_s.like system.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.We obtained the transcripts of both events from the New York Times 2 .One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.recommender systems 
JESTER 1.0
The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in 
Loading and preprocessing 
 the ontology.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection
Evaluation.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .Technorati.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF..The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.The 
MRD used is The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
LDOCE.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.bl1  ,bl2  ,.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.The better results between the two runs are shown in 
Comparisons among performance on different datasets
In Table 13    , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06    , 07    , and 08.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection    , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 
 INTRODUCTION
A large and increasing number of people are using Web search engine to seek information today.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.Next    , the chart parser is used to analyse the LDOCE definition of an 'ammeter'    , which is that it "is an instrument for measuring .,b1n .For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental setup
TPC-W benchmark.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.Consider a news website such as New York Times.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection 
One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.TDT corpora 
Results.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC 
Evaluation Measures
TDT project has its own evaluation plan.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the

A.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.Pinterest
Pinterest is a pinboard-style image sharing social network    , where everything is about photos and videos.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers 
TPC-W Benchmark
The TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.Agency Budget and New York Times News 
2 .The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.Stack 
Overflow.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.Raw text was extracted from the XML format of the AQU- AINT-2 and Blog06 collections.Some services incur either 271

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.Evaluation
 Our final run on the evaluation portion of TDT-2 produced 146 clusters.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.4 This NIST policy was not made public at development time    , but we had chosen to create our own internal blog question test set from BLOG06 snippets that can serve as answers.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features

CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.The remaining words ill LDOCE is expected to be defined ill the next defining cycle.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.This is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times that includes the article title    , byline    , publication date    , and URL.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.Interestingly    , CMU    , the top performing group    , experimented with both types of index    , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.Introduction

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.New York Time Annotated Corpus

Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out."1'o automatically produce the thesaurus from LDOCE    , two programs have been dcveloped:

Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.Introduction

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.In 2013    , Jiaul H. Paik

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.This realization has led various retail giants such as WalMart 
RELATED WORK
An attempt has been made to make the process of hiring an auto simpler by an initiative launched in Bangalore by the city police and the transport authority    , called Easy Auto 4 .The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.It is likely that monitoring all items for sale at Walmart    , say    , is not of interest.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of

To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.– The gene ExpressionPattern being revealed in the image    , as defined by the Drosophila anatomy ontology 5 .Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.Rel Doc Densities 
WT2g Link Densities 
Connectivity data
Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g.For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.The BLOG06 collection contains approximately 100k feed documents    , which are a mix of ATOM and RSS XML.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.Experimental results    , obtained using the LETOR benchmark    , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.Consider all the suggested queries QTDT     , TP  that are    , both in the list that is dwelled for no shorter than TDT     , and    , ranked at positions no lower than TP dwell time ≥ TDT and position ≤ TP .Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.electric current."DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia

Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.precision = P C
Implementation
 The collection used in the experiments is part of TDT- 3 1 .instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.In the end    , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.The first term is as in 
New York Times Articles N > 2 
We perform our approach on New York Times articles.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.Data
The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.Figure 2: Images from Pinterest collections by a Police department and an image uploaded to a wedding pinboard.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error

METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.Drexel

The ECNUCS results merging run basedef simply returns the output of the official FedWeb resource selection baseline.A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.Lucene was able to index the whole Blog06
Data Preprocessing -Content Extraction
Web pages are cluttered with distracting features around the body of a blog post which distract the user from the content block.The resuiting TDT corpus includes 15  ,863 news stories spanning July 1    , 1994    , through June 30    , 1995.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 
The Case Studies
 The my Grid project has developed a service-oriented architecture to enable bioinformaticians to: gather distributed data; use data and analysis tools presented as services; compose and enact workflows; and to manage the generated 
User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.Three of the most accessible were the Merriam-Webster Pock& Dictionary MPD    , its larger sibling    , the Merriam-Webster Seventh Colegiate ~7 and the Longman Di@ionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.4 Validation on new data sets    , such as the Jester data set 
 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.For blog distillation    , the Blog06 corpus contains around 100k blogs    , and is a Web-like setting with anchor text    , linkage    , spam    , etc.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.  , Pinterest by ind resp.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained

The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We implemented our TSA approach using the New York Times archive 1863-2004.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.We can see that the performance on Blog-2008 is worse compared to Blog06 and Blog 07.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times

Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.We further augment the dictionary with terms of interest that are not present in FOLDOC    , in particular    , topics addressed by W3C standards.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.Conclusion
 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.According to a recent survey made by Technorati 
RCS ARCHITECTURE
INCREMENTAL STORY CLUSTERING
Note the daily crawled data could be treated as a data stream.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.New York 
Times.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.For example     , The New York Times and Chicago Tribune provide different viewpoints in their coverage of stories on health care and national defense.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.Dataset Description
Stack Overflow provides a periodic database dump of all user-generated content under the Creative Commons Attribute- ShareAlike 
Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources 
Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.  , |{d ∈ Dn|appearsc    , d}| |Dn|

In the experiments described in this paper we used New York Times articles since 1870 for history.Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.pins for majority to appear 
PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.BIB 
Questions were put to us concerning the accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes.
