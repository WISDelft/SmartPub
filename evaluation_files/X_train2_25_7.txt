Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.We leave the smaller leaf intact.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude.

CONCLUSIONS
We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube.A Case Study
To further analyze the effectiveness of the proposed CRTER model    , out of the 550 test topics used in our experiments    , we conduct a case study on topic 867 on the Blog06 collection.We use MERT

Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.  dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20    , selected using LocusLink information.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?However    , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages.The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Ellen Spertus for her assistance with the Orkut data    , and Tim Heilman for his assistance with generating datasets for semantic query similarity.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.Next    , we generate the XML format for our annotated corpus    , which is similar to the data format in SemEval-10 Task 10.Semantic Search Engine 
The dictionary for finding gene mentions was automatically derived from the full LocusLink database    , and included 156  ,533 genes with a total of 387  ,850 synonyms.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.While the definition of blog distillation as explained above is different    , the idea is to provide the users with the key blogs about 
Topics and Relevance Judgments
 For the purposes of the blog distillation task    , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor 
Results
On the SemEval-2007 data set    , the basic configuration of simplified Lesk SL+0—i.e.We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.Main experiments
In Table 1    , the results of Siamese CBOW on 20 SemEval datasets are displayed    , together with the results of the baseline systems.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in 
Loading and preprocessing 
 the ontology.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection
Evaluation.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.Thus both clusters are left intact.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.The better results between the two runs are shown in 
Comparisons among performance on different datasets
In Table 13    , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06    , 07    , and 08.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection    , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 
 INTRODUCTION
A large and increasing number of people are using Web search engine to seek information today.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents    , learned contemporary works    , articles from journals    , etc.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.His visual fields are intact.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.length on FBIS.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i    , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.For English    , both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the MFS.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.Raw text was extracted from the XML format of the AQU- AINT-2 and Blog06 collections.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.4 This NIST policy was not made public at development time    , but we had chosen to create our own internal blog question test set from BLOG06 snippets that can serve as answers.Supplementary evaluations are described in the subsequent sections that include the comparison with SemEval-2 participating systems    , and the analysis of model dynamics with the experimental data.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .In this way    , the global schema remains intact.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.Interestingly    , CMU    , the top performing group    , experimented with both types of index    , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.REFERENCES

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.Results on NASDAQ Dataset
 Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.The rest of the order was preserved intact.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.We used a version of the LocusLink database containing 128  ,580 entries.that must have her mark intact.Her own practice in her office with digital material was almost entirely of on-screen reading from her laptop; mostly of digital journals    , but also of online scans of mediaeval material.The average blog entry in our BLOG06 index has 220 words.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.Results

" customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Experiments
Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.– The gene ExpressionPattern being revealed in the image    , as defined by the Drosophila anatomy ontology 5 .A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

Experimental results on FBIS corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and our lexicalized reordering model.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.Use Case

The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in

Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset

.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method 
Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Analysis on Model Dynamics
This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.Lucene was able to index the whole Blog06
Data Preprocessing -Content Extraction
Web pages are cluttered with distracting features around the body of a blog post which distract the user from the content block.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology

User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink 
CONCEPT EXTRACTION.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.  , mediaeval history.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.For blog distillation    , the Blog06 corpus contains around 100k blogs    , and is a Web-like setting with anchor text    , linkage    , spam    , etc.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .If q = −1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.Experiment and Evaluation
Dataset
Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.We can see that the performance on Blog-2008 is worse compared to Blog06 and Blog 07.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.LocusLink

Conclusions and Future work
 This paper proposes a new approach for computing word similarity between Chinese words using HowNet.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.SemEval Keyphrase Extraction Data
In addition to our four collections of index terms    , we used an existing dataset for keyphrase extraction evaluation — the SemEval-2010 keyphrase extraction data.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.While Celestial is a distinct    , freely-downloadable software package    , at Southampton University 
Citebase Search
Citebase    , more fully described by Hitchcock et al.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.Orkut also offers friend relationship.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.The data provided by AcroMed 4     , LocusLink 5     , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.
