Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.GDELT indexes documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average    , whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Ellen Spertus for her assistance with the Orkut data    , and Tim Heilman for his assistance with generating datasets for semantic query similarity.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.The dataset is available for research at https://github.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.RELATED WORK
Stack Overflow is a collaborative question answering Stack Exchange website.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.What we learned from this study is that we should carefully use GDELT and ER for research because the two datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news sources.We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.In general     , however    , the algorithm should not make a choice of which trees to prune and which to keep intact.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.We find a significantly high correlation between the news geographies of ER and GDELT ρ=0.867    , p=1.896e-74.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from 63  ,268 websites    , and ER from 20  ,754 websites.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.Thus both clusters are left intact.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements

 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.However    , given that we are interested in the peak in the coverage    , rather than in the number of events    , here we directly use the news articles    , not the events automatically mapped by GDELT; applying a consistent methodology for detecting events.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental setup
TPC-W benchmark.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection 
One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.His visual fields are intact.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.length on FBIS.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i    , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.a BeerAdvocate; b RateBeer.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.We used GDELT http://gdeltproject.org/ news dataset for our experiments.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers 
TPC-W Benchmark
The TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.Stack

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.The source code is available at the official Github repository .As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.The What block of 
CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times more documents than ER does per day.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.REFERENCES
 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.We use GDELT    , currently the largest global event catalog    , to automatically discover relevant events with high MSM coverage.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.Results on NASDAQ Dataset
 Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.The rest of the order was preserved intact.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers

This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.In

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.Western musical scales may be transformed    , or transposed     , to any other key so that the corresponding pitch intervals remain intact.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation

Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.These queries are listed in 
The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.To locate the URLs corresponding to news articles relevant to climate change    , we rely on GDELT themes and taxonomies    , which are topical tags that automatically annotate events.  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.Discussion

Experimental results on FBIS corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and our lexicalized reordering model.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.7 GDELT covers a " cross-section of all major international    , national    , regional    , local    , and hyper-local news sources    , both print and broadcast    , from nearly every corner of the globe " 8 including major international news sources.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.To systematically identify all the GDELT themes and taxonomies that are related to climate change we first built the co-occurrence graph among them.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.GitHub Watchers.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.In our analysis of GitHub

Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The code is available at https://github.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.D. Findings 
 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Please consult 
Characterization Results 
Network Properties 
Subscription to Services and Aggregation 
This section dives into the social aggregation properties of FriendFeed.GDELT contains a set of entities for each article ; however    , we ignored these annotations and solely relied on our own methods to extract and disambiguate entities.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Examples of such data include GDELT gdeltproject .org and Recorded Future www.recordedfuture.com.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.If q = −1    , no stored user constraints need to be enforced and the unedited result list L 0 q will be presented intact .Consequently the original datasets were left intact.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.We use the Comparison between GDELT and ER Scale One of the most important criteria for the comparison is the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehensive the dataset is.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Then    , we extract all the unique URLs corresponding to events annotated in GDELT with one of these themes for each day.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .Dataset Description

Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .Orkut also offers friend relationship.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site

DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.
