Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases    , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.Figure 2: Images from Pinterest collections by a Police department and an image uploaded to a wedding pinboard.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.The dataset is available for research at https://github.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Prior Interaction â€“ Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.  , Pinterest by ind resp.Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.The source code is available at the official Github repository .Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.Results on NASDAQ Dataset
 Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.The code is available at https://github.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.pins for majority to appear 
PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

System Model
In this section    , we present the operational features of ONYX.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.Pinterest
Pinterest is a pinboard-style image sharing social network    , where everything is about photos and videos.In our analysis of GitHub 
II.For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.GitHub Watchers.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Later    , in Â§5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.
