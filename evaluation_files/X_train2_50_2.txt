Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.On Reddit    , over half of articles were discarded because they appeared for less than an hour in the range of positions studied.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .Examples of such data include GDELT gdeltproject .org and Recorded Future www.recordedfuture.com.TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.We observe similar trends in Quora.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.Creating individual preprocessing rules for each repository in the collection is not a scalable solution for OAIster    , or any other large metadata collection.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.In 
Binding
Now    , given a query word wi    , we need to find the erroneous variants from the OCRed corpus.Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     , 
where sgt is the word embedding vector of term t learned by the SkipGram algorithm 
bm d tq = arg max t d ∈d simtq    , t d  bmqt d  = arg max tq ∈q simtq    , t d  δst    , d = simt    , bm d t 
δsq    , t = simbmqt    , t     , 4 Term repetition is avoided since the number of occurrences of the term t in d is already counted in fL i .Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.The annotators unified their schemes by consensus into a hierarchical scheme with 6 coarse-grained and 31 fine-grained motivational factors additional details available at networkdynamics.org/pubs/2016/reddit-exodus/.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.While discerning ironic comments on reddit is our immediate task    , the proposed approach is generally applicable to a wide-range of subjective     , web-based text classification tasks.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We also used private messaging PM features on Reddit and Voat to solicit participation from randomly-selected users.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.Future Directions for OAIster
The University of Michigan intends to continue researching the use of OAI in a variety of ways.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.In this paper    , we construct a dataset from Reddit and present the first large-scale study on the coexistence of highly related communities.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.We define a video to be " discovered " on Reddit if it's score was in the top 10% of scores of posts to r/videos in 2012.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.GitHub Watchers.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.What we learned from this study is that we should carefully use GDELT and ER for research because the two datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news sources.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.We find a significantly high correlation between the news geographies of ER and GDELT ρ=0.867    , p=1.896e-74.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.University of Amsterdam Team

This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.Historic Newspaper Collection
The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.We find that positivity of feedback in Reddit    , the difference in upvotes and downvotes may play a substantial role    , as shown by the figure below.BRIGHTKITE.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.Threats to Validity

Stability of Quora topics 
 In this section    , we shall perform stability analysis of the popular topics.For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.We are encouraged by our method's ability to recover ground truth from the MusicLab experiment but we recognize that although Reddit and Hacker News are similar in some ways    , they are fundamentally different.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.By way of this feature    , reddit enables an individual create accounts in a matter of minutes without giving out an email address.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.Experiments

EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.Surveys were first posted publicly to communities on Reddit    , Voat    , Hubski    , Empeopled    , Snapzu    , Stacksity    , Piroot    , HackerNews    , Linkibl    , SaidWho and Qetzl.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .Harvested metadata that has no corresponding digital resource is not indexed in OAIster.This enriched metadata could then be distributed to meet the needs of access services    , preservation repositories    , and external aggregation services such as OAIster.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS

 is the relevance level of the document with rank i in π    , and GK L is a normalizing constant that ensures that a perfect ordering has an NDCG value of 1.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.OAIster can be found online at http://www.oaister.org/    , with over a million records available from over 140 institutions.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .Evaluation
Ideally we would like to evaluate our quality estimates against some ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .The first term is as in

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.For example    , in the New York Times front page shown in 
Structural Analysis
Our structural analysis of an HTML document is based on the key observations mentioned above.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.To locate the URLs corresponding to news articles relevant to climate change    , we rely on GDELT themes and taxonomies    , which are topical tags that automatically annotate events.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in

The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.Reddit http://reddit.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.,b1n .An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.We use GDELT    , currently the largest global event catalog    , to automatically discover relevant events with high MSM coverage.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.Then    , we extract all the unique URLs corresponding to events annotated in GDELT with one of these themes for each day.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.Figure 2: Images from Pinterest collections by a Police department and an image uploaded to a wedding pinboard.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.During the parsing of the XML file    , the system calculates features for every word    , line    , paragraph    , and page of the OCRed text.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.On Reddit    , users employ subreddits to discuss everything from crochet to conspiracy theories.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.length on FBIS.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.While Celestial is a distinct    , freely-downloadable software package    , at Southampton University 
Citebase Search
Citebase    , more fully described by Hitchcock et al.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.User query strings were extracted by automated means from a sample of OAIster transaction logs recorded a few days each month over several months in 2003 and 2004.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.Interestingly    , the most popular forum among U. S. workers is Reddit HWTF while international workers are most likely to use MTurkForum.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.The Topic Model
In this paper we use the topic model for subject metadata enrichment of the OAIster collection.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.They start out with a high comment-to-submission ratio relative to users in their cohort who abandon Reddit more quickly.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.TDT corpora 
Results.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Data Description
We used the Letor 2 data collection 
Evaluation Measures
 In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms     , three evaluation measures are applied: Precision    , Mean average precision and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain

Mean Average Precision.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.The code is available at https://github.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.Reddit allows for threaded conversations    , where users can comment over other comments.We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from 63  ,268 websites    , and ER from 20  ,754 websites.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.  , Pinterest by ind resp.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.The rest of the order was preserved intact.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.Reddit HWTF in particular displays a variety of features e.g.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.An interesting feature of reddit    , is the 'throwaway account'.that must have her mark intact.The ten largest repositories by size in MB from our 9/2/2006 OAIster harvest are listed in

The metadata OAIster collects is in Simple Dublin Core format.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.The dataset in 
Characterizing affixes 
The goal of this section is to explore the types of canonical affixes users on Reddit utilize.In the Reddit dataset    , the median article received 38 votes upvotes plus downvotes    , while the median Hacker News article received 21 votes    , with a minimum of 3 votes in each case.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings

Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.We preprocessed the OAIster collection to produce the bag-of-words representation as follows: Starting with the 668 repositories in the 9/2/2006 harvest    , we excluded 163 primarily non-English repositories    , and 117 small repositories containing fewer than 500 records    , leaving 388 repositories.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.Thus    , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line    , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.Drexel

PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.APPENDIX
Full-life view for users in Reddit.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.This work is a preliminary exploration    , focusing on a set of high precision reddit communities    , however expanding to other subreddits is a ripe area of future research.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.New York 
Times.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.One might conjecture either that MTurkGrind has developed into an independent    , more socialized community partly from a pool of Reddit HWTF users    , or that MTurk- Grind has started to attract users from Reddit HWTF who seek more social interactions.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.The dataset is available for research at https://github.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.This realization has led various retail giants such as WalMart 
RELATED WORK
An attempt has been made to make the process of hiring an auto simpler by an initiative launched in Bangalore by the city police and the transport authority    , called Easy Auto 4 .The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times more documents than ER does per day.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark

 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times 
Related research is briefly discussed in Section 2.We leave the smaller leaf intact.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Our principal argument is that simple bag-of-words based text classification models – which    , when coupled with sufficient data    , have proven to be extremely successful for many natural language processing tasks 
 We introduce the first version of the reddit irony corpus    , composed of annotated comments from the social news website reddit.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.The overall average gap is 749 days since 2008    , when users on Reddit were first allowed to create their own communities.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.Answers and StackOverflow    , the Reddit dataset offers following unique advantages.7 GDELT covers a " cross-section of all major international    , national    , regional    , local    , and hyper-local news sources    , both print and broadcast    , from nearly every corner of the globe " 8 including major international news sources.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.Agency Budget and New York Times News 
2 .In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.Orkut also offers friend relationship.Many alternatives to Reddit saw a substantial increase in their relative post and comment volumes; however    , the volume on Reddit was largely unchanged    , indicating that the events had minimal effect on Reddit itself.recommender systems 
JESTER 1.0
The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .GDELT releases data about daily media coverage in two formats: the Event Database and the Global Knowledge Graph GKG.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We implemented our TSA approach using the New York Times archive 1863-2004.The What block of 
CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection 
One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.The other two AMA's are open to a more wider audience for sharing their life events and allowing other reddit users to ask questions related to those events.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.To compare users' behavior on Reddit with that on the alternative platforms     , we leverage the fact that many alternatives feature subreddits with direct analogs to those seen on Reddit    , e.g.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.Discussion

Connectivity data
Nick Craswell developed software for extracting hyper-link connectivity information from WT2g.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.The data comprises comments scraped from the social news website reddit.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.Thus    , creating consistent enriched subject metadata is one of the biggest challenges of the OAIster collection.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.Both Reddit and Hacker News display the current score of articles    , and thus provide a signal about how other users evaluated these articles.All

Conclusion and Future Work
We have proposed a vocabulary    , SCOVO    , and discussed good practice guidelines for publishing statistical data on the Web in this paper.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.Detection Evaluation Methodology 
The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.  , Brightkite 
The second example illustrates how distributing a dataset allows one to achieve a particular task    , while minimizing the disclosure of sensitive information.4 Validation on new data sets    , such as the Jester data set 
 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.Characterizing Multi-Site Users
 Individuals cited multiple reasons for why they were motivated to leave Reddit and try a new platform.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.These rankings reveal whether long-tail Reddit content is accessible on the alternative in its most popular commu- nities.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.For all runs    , FOLDOC was used in the query analysis process for query expansion.Since their inscription    , the primary functionality of the te'amim    , to structure pronunciation and syntax    , remained intact.System under Test 
The TPC-W Benchmark 
Web 
B.Multiple Formats 
Similarly    , a digital document may exist in different media types    , such as plain text    , HTML    , I&TEX    , DVI    , postscript    , scanned-image    , OCRed text    , or certain PC-a.pplication format.The tool that transforms OAIster metadata from Simple Dublin Core to our native DLXS Bibliographic Class was modified so that it could ingest the file from the first step    , and output a transformed metadata record.We run experiments for several choices of V : parts-of-speech    , the 100 most frequent words in Reddit    , and the 500 most frequent words in Reddit.Differences in Social Support 
Does the nature of feedback or social support from the greater reddit community also differ in the case of posts from anonymous accounts  ?When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.For example     , The New York Times and Chicago Tribune provide different viewpoints in their coverage of stories on health care and national defense.WikiWars.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.We take migration to be a substantial shift in activity    , wherein the user's smoothed activity is higher on alternatives than on Reddit for at least two weeks.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.A server that crashes subsequently recovers with its stable storage intact.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.  , Walmart.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.In addition to listing the citing articles    , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.The forum component of reddit is extremely active: popular posts often have well into 1000's of user comments .INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.  , by ranking them    , or featuring targets on the Reddit home page.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.The source code is available at the official Github repository .The unique feature of OAIster is that it provides access to metadata pointing to actual digital resources.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.We use the Comparison between GDELT and ER Scale One of the most important criteria for the comparison is the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehensive the dataset is.It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .For each post    , Reddit provides the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.They can thus make the choice to dissociate from their reddit identity by simply using an alternate pseudonym and then leaving it behind.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.The two metrics are as follows: 
Experimental Results
Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users 
Dataset N K N GC k C D EF F D l 
Brightkite vides a public API to search and download these messages.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.GDELT indexes documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average    , whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.In comparison    , Reddit HWTF    , MTurkGrind    , and MTurk- Forum appear to be mostly dedicated to discussions about details of MTurk work.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.ok200706301185791252056 "     , what you get is a profile which is built runtime by querying all the data sources on the web which are indexed by Sindice 5 .We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.This functionality is only possible if we have reliable    , consistent and appropriate subject metadata for each of the ten million records in OAIster.According to a recent survey of Quora users

Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.Status    , in both in the Reddit community as well as the RAOP subcommunity    , turns out to be strongly correlated with success.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .Consider a news website such as New York Times.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.Finally    , dual citizens have activity on alternatives that was sustained for longer than one week    , but their activity is not consistently higher on alternatives than Reddit.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.We find this method is effective at recovering ground truth quality parameters     , and further show that it provides a good fit for Reddit and Hacker News data.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS

We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.This is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times that includes the article title    , byline    , publication date    , and URL.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.In contrast    , tourists exhibit a sudden burst in activity on Reddit alternatives and then no further activity there.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.Conclusion 
We have presented    , to the best of our knowledge    , the first comprehensive study of mental health discourse on the social media reddit.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.Notably    , they identify Reddit users as having a high propensity to move to alternate platforms.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .Since we lack the ability to evaluate against ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News    , we evaluate this model on data from the MusicLab experiment.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.Experiments

 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .We use the Gerbil testing platform 
Evaluation metrics.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems

 Quora applies a voting system that leverages crowdsourced efforts to promote good answers.However    , given that we are interested in the peak in the coverage    , rather than in the number of events    , here we directly use the news articles    , not the events automatically mapped by GDELT; applying a consistent methodology for detecting events.Various celebrities and noteworthy personalities have used reddit as a means to interact with Internet users    , such conversations fall under the Ask-Me-Anything and its variant subreddits.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude.

Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.Datasets

 Introduction
Socially-curated websites such as Reddit depend on large communities for content creation and moderation 
The Reddit Controversy
 Reddit is the most popular exemplar 1 of a class of websites known as social content aggregators    , on which users can post new content as well as vote and comment on each other's content.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in

1 Supervised classification.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.However we cannot directly estimate the probability of receiving a vote versus not receiving a vote    , for both Reddit and Hacker News.bl1  ,bl2  ,.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.Second    , posting is not affected by a confounding factor that commenting is subject to: Reddit influences commenting by how it presents potential targets for comments e.g.LabelMe 4 .Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.We summarize the relationships between different entities in

 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.We obtained the transcripts of both events from the New York Times 2 .In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.Some services incur either 271

Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.Zhu    , Kraut    , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.Third    , the way that comments are presented on Reddit makes scraping the complete commenting history rather difficult.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.TDT has been more and more important.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.GDELT contains a set of entities for each article ; however    , we ignored these annotations and solely relied on our own methods to extract and disambiguate entities.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.This research reveals how social media like reddit are fulfilling unique information and social needs of a cohort challenged with a stigmatic health concern looking through the lenses of disclosure    , social support    , and disinhibition.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.In the reddit dataset    , the responder in each IAmA is a single notable personality with average reply rate of around 10.16%.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.By mapping these communities     , when a user posts to an alternative    , we can identify how popular the corresponding subreddit would be on Reddit .The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com 
¯ F x = 1 − F x = P X > x 
on log-log axes.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .  , d -1 all the children of the old node n whose parent edge weight was congruent to i mod d. Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The quality of Reddit article is estimated as: 
Q i = λ sub · e qi · r up i − r down i  3 
We include the subscript in the λ sub term to emphasize that this constant is different across subreddits.To systematically identify all the GDELT themes and taxonomies that are related to climate change we first built the co-occurrence graph among them.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.Reddit and each of the remaining 21 alternative platforms were crawled for all publicly available content.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the

The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.Collaborating with other projects that could benefit from using OAIster    , e.g.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors

1 1 = w     , 1 .The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.We would also like to thank the University of Michigan for the sample of OAIster transaction log data used in our analyses.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.
