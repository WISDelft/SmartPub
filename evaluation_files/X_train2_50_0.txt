Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.Section 2 describes the size    , origin    , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.We observe similar trends in Quora.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .Present scale and span
 So far    , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties    , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events    , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.claims    , we chose a particular number of  
Chemical Entity Recognition and Query Expansion with Synonyms from PubChem
A distinct feature of chemical documents in general is the fact that chemical molecules in those documents can be represented in multiple textual ways    , and a simple keyword search would not suffice to have effective results.The most comprehensive open access database for the area of chemistry is PubChem 14 .Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.The Mean Average Precision MAP results for HGT and NIPS are shown in 
SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.Introduction

Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.This approach is taken in the PubChem Compound Database http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for users to search similar graphs for a given query graph.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .GitHub Watchers.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.To our surprise    , although gIndex is the oldest method among all representative graph indexing techniques we consider    , it performs the best for sparse datasets AIDS and PubChem since its pruning power is the best    , and thus    , the I/O cost is usually the lowest.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.BRIGHTKITE.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink

 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.Nevertheless    , the experts in the chemical domain have provided a dictionary-based binary fingerprint for chemical structures in Pubchem dataset for similarity search.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .By distributing tasks or questions to large numbers of Internet users    , these " crowd-sourcing " systems have done everything from answering user questions Quora    , to translating books    , creating 3-D photo tours

CROWDTURFING OVERVIEW
 In this section    , we introduce the core concepts related to crowdturfing .To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.To do our first experiment    , we took a random 1‰ sample of the PubChem database resulting in around 48.000 chemical entities.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.See

A.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.As a case study    , we collect a Chinese hotel review dataset from booking.com.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.In the following    , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL.D. Findings 
 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.Results

Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.Word Sense Disambiguation System
The word sense disambiguation algorithm we developed is based on popular ideas from the literature 
In order to provide empirical knowledge for use by our WSD system we created a bootstrapped representation of the Brown1 document set which is part of the Semcor corpus.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.Figure 2: Images from Pinterest collections by a Police department and an image uploaded to a wedding pinboard.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method 
Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.To be considered non-rare    , a word needed to have occurred in SemCor at least once i.e.First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W

The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.Introduction

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.SemCor 
Comparison systems.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified    , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.TDT corpora 
Results.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents    , learned contemporary works    , articles from journals    , etc.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.The code is available at https://github.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.  , Pinterest by ind resp.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent    , mesur:Document    , and mesur:Context 7 .According to a recent survey made by Technorati

INCREMENTAL STORY CLUSTERING
Note the daily crawled data could be treated as a data stream.Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 
.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.SemEval 2007 Web People Search Results
 The best system in SemEval 2007 obtained an Fscore of 0.78    , the average F-score of all 16 participant systems is 0.60.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .The probability of generating the expansion terms is defined as 
P Q | Θ D  = |Q | q i P q i | Θ D  w i W 4 
where q i is a expansion term    , W = |Q | i=1 w i and w i is the weight we give to a expansion term    , which we can see as the relatedness between the original query Q and the expansion term    , and is computed as 
w i = P q | Q = N j=1 P q | c j P c j | Q 5 
 where c is a concept returned by the expansion algorithm     , N is the number of concepts we chose for the expansion    , P q | c j  is estimated using the sense probabilities estimated from Semcor i.e.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.For WebKB dataset we learnt 10 topics.pins for majority to appear 
PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.An example of an Affiliation state context is diagrammed in 
Affiliation 
The Metric Context
The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.The dataset is available for research at https://github.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental setup
TPC-W benchmark.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources 
Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.From those terms    , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.precision = P C
Implementation
 The collection used in the experiments is part of TDT- 3 1 .In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .The Gerbil platform already integrates the methods of Agdis- tis 
Results
Results of the experiments run on the Gerbil platform are shown in 
Discussion.Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics    , calculates them for the established reference data set    , and assesses their validity and reliability.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.The similarity of two graphs is defined as the Tanimoto score of their fingerprints in PubChem.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.Orkut also offers friend relationship.recommender systems 
JESTER 1.0
The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search.Analysis on Model Dynamics
This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.As a result    , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.For the user study    , we have randomly chosen 10 query entities from PubChem    , each of them representing one feedback cycle inside the system.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.For the purposes of the MESUR project    , a network-based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.Therefore    , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set.The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection 
One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project    , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time    , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.aggregation ingestion

Figure 1: Overview of MESUR project phases.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .Detection Evaluation Methodology 
The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.  , Brightkite 
The second example illustrates how distributing a dataset allows one to achieve a particular task    , while minimizing the disclosure of sensitive information.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in

 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.Experiment and Evaluation
Dataset
Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset 
Experimental Results
8 in Section 3.3.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.System under Test

Comparison systems.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.We used a version of the LocusLink database containing 128  ,580 entries.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.Next    , we generate the XML format for our annotated corpus    , which is similar to the data format in SemEval-10 Task 10.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.A novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies

Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.In addition to listing the citing articles    , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .More information about this dataset can be found in 
The 
The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.The source code is available at the official Github repository .It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Therefore     , the MESUR owl:ObjectProperty taxonomy provides two types of object properties: ContextProperty and InferredProperty see

Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor 
Results
On the SemEval-2007 data set    , the basic configuration of simplified Lesk SL+0—i.e.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.Craigslist.For English    , both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the MFS.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.For the large dataset    , we use a real chemical compound dataset referred to here as PubChem.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users 
Dataset N K N GC k C D EF F D l 
Brightkite vides a public API to search and download these messages.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB 
Comparisons.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.PubChem has 23.98 vertices and 25.76 edges    , on average .In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.Her own practice in her office with digital material was almost entirely of on-screen reading from her laptop; mostly of digital journals    , but also of online scans of mediaeval material.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .Semantic Search Engine

Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus    , is still in its early stages of development.We select the check-in occurred during January 2010 to September 2010 from the original Brightkite 
Comparison Methods.To study the effect of q which is the length of NBC for each projected dimension    , we evaluate our MH methods on 22K LabelMe and 100K TinyImage by setting the q to three different values 2    , 3    , and 4.  , mediaeval history.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.Conclusion
 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.Furthermore    , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.We use the Gerbil testing platform 
Evaluation metrics.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems

We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.REFERENCES
 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.As our training corpus we opted for two available resources: SemCor and OMSTI.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC

 Introduction
 The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population TAC-KBP Slot Filling SF task 
1 Supervised classification.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.LabelMe 4 .Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.Some services incur either 271

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.Procedure
For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.TDT has been more and more important.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database

 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?Results

The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.  , features 7–12 in 
Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com

on log-log axes.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.To address this problem we used the PubChem SQL dump to store all entity data in a file based hash map.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.PubChem consists of 1 million graphs and is a subset of the PubChem chemical structure database 4 .More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the 
 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 
The Case Studies
 The my Grid project has developed a service-oriented architecture to enable bioinformaticians to: gather distributed data; use data and analysis tools presented as services; compose and enact workflows; and to manage the generated 
User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.In certain cases    , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form    , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 .This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors 
Projection Methods
 We evaluate NPQ quantisation performance with five projection schemes: LSH-based projections

II.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .term InChI=1S/C5H8O/c1-2-4-6-5- 3-1/h2  ,4H  ,1  ,3  ,5H2 
cannot be found because the responsible entity in the original document could not be matched uniquely to the PubChem entities.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site

Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.  , PubChem    , social networks e.g.Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.Reference data set representation
 The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes    , cites    , uses and different types of content bibliographic data    , citation data    , usage data    , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 
Research data set
 The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor    , this is representative of the current state of the art systems
