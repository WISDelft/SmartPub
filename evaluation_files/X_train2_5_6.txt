In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.Estimation Accuracy: We compare our CLA size estimators with a systematic excerpt 
End-to-End Experiments
 To study end-to-end CLA benefits    , we ran several algorithms over subsets of Mnist480m and ImageNet.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.Note that as ImageNet is still a resource under development    , not all word pairs in the datasets presented in section 4 are covered.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.There are large numbers of tags and users; orders of magnitude larger than the 1  ,000 categories of ImageNet.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.The weights of DNN are learned on ILSVRC-2010 1     , which is a subset of ImageNet 2 dataset with 1.26 million training images from 1  ,000 categories.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.We then give details on the key Quora graph structures that connect different components together.EXPERIMENTS
Data Sets and Distance Functions
 We employ three image data sets: CoPhIR    , SIFT    , ImageNet     , and several data sets created from textual data.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.By distributing tasks or questions to large numbers of Internet users    , these " crowd-sourcing " systems have done everything from answering user questions Quora    , to translating books    , creating 3-D photo tours

CROWDTURFING OVERVIEW
 In this section    , we introduce the core concepts related to crowdturfing .To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.3 We evaluate our model and features on the ImageNet hierarchies with two different taxonomy induction tasks Section 5.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.We observe similar trends in Quora.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .It would be useful to search for objects using multiple pre-trained visual detection models    , such as a 200-class ImageNet Detection model and a 1  ,000-class ImageNet Recognition and Localisation model.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in 
Loading and preprocessing

Single-word image retrieval 
 In order to visualize the acquired meaning for individual words    , we use images from the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet 
Sentence structure
In the following experiments    , we examine the knowledge of sentence structure learned by IMAG- INET    , and its impact on the model performance on image and paraphrase retrieval.Introduction

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.– The gene ExpressionPattern being revealed in the image    , as defined by the Drosophila anatomy ontology 5 .Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.Impact on Voting
 Quora applies a voting system that leverages crowdsourced efforts to promote good answers.In 
Stability of Quora topics 
 In this section    , we shall perform stability analysis of the popular topics.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology 
The Case Studies
 The my Grid project has developed a service-oriented architecture to enable bioinformaticians to: gather distributed data; use data and analysis tools presented as services; compose and enact workflows; and to manage the generated 
User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.
