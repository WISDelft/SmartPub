Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.On Reddit    , over half of articles were discarded because they appeared for less than an hour in the range of positions studied.The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.claims    , we chose a particular number of  
Chemical Entity Recognition and Query Expansion with Synonyms from PubChem
A distinct feature of chemical documents in general is the fact that chemical molecules in those documents can be represented in multiple textual ways    , and a simple keyword search would not suffice to have effective results.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.The most comprehensive open access database for the area of chemistry is PubChem 14 .Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.Thus in spite of the fact that the definition of a textual unit as a whole document might have a negative impact on the results    , the general ability of our filters to identify content bearing words remains intact.The Mean Average Precision MAP results for HGT and NIPS are shown in 
SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.Introduction
Temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different SemEval tasks 
Related work
 The present work is closely related to previous approaches involved in TempEval campaigns 
TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering
In the SemEval task 4 TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering 
Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.The annotators unified their schemes by consensus into a hierarchical scheme with 6 coarse-grained and 31 fine-grained motivational factors additional details available at networkdynamics.org/pubs/2016/reddit-exodus/.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.EXPERIMENTS
Data Sets and Distance Functions
 We employ three image data sets: CoPhIR    , SIFT    , ImageNet     , and several data sets created from textual data.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.Word similarity judgment For similarity judgment correlations    , we selected two existing benchmarks that have the largest vocabulary overlap with our data: MEN 3K 
Single-word image retrieval 
 In order to visualize the acquired meaning for individual words    , we use images from the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet 
Sentence structure
In the following experiments    , we examine the knowledge of sentence structure learned by IMAG- INET    , and its impact on the model performance on image and paraphrase retrieval.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.While discerning ironic comments on reddit is our immediate task    , the proposed approach is generally applicable to a wide-range of subjective     , web-based text classification tasks.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.We also used private messaging PM features on Reddit and Voat to solicit participation from randomly-selected users.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.This approach is taken in the PubChem Compound Database http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for users to search similar graphs for a given query graph.In this paper    , we construct a dataset from Reddit and present the first large-scale study on the coexistence of highly related communities.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."We define a video to be " discovered " on Reddit if it's score was in the top 10% of scores of posts to r/videos in 2012.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.GitHub Watchers.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.University of Amsterdam Team

This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.To our surprise    , although gIndex is the oldest method among all representative graph indexing techniques we consider    , it performs the best for sparse datasets AIDS and PubChem since its pruning power is the best    , and thus    , the I/O cost is usually the lowest.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.We find that positivity of feedback in Reddit    , the difference in upvotes and downvotes may play a substantial role    , as shown by the figure below.BRIGHTKITE.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.Please consult

We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.REFERENCES
 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.We are encouraged by our method's ability to recover ground truth from the MusicLab experiment but we recognize that although Reddit and Hacker News are similar in some ways    , they are fundamentally different.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.Hence static integration is a manipulation on the data representation    , the SMT system is kept intact.By way of this feature    , reddit enables an individual create accounts in a matter of minutes without giving out an email address.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.In this way    , the global schema remains intact.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.Sel 
Note that the resulting circuit leaves all tuples essentially intact    , but invalidates discarded tuples by setting their data valid flag to false.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.Nevertheless    , the experts in the chemical domain have provided a dictionary-based binary fingerprint for chemical structures in Pubchem dataset for similarity search.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.Reddit Reddit is composed of many different subcommunities called " subreddits " .14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.Surveys were first posted publicly to communities on Reddit    , Voat    , Hubski    , Empeopled    , Snapzu    , Stacksity    , Piroot    , HackerNews    , Linkibl    , SaidWho and Qetzl.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.Estimation Accuracy: We compare our CLA size estimators with a systematic excerpt 
End-to-End Experiments
 To study end-to-end CLA benefits    , we ran several algorithms over subsets of Mnist480m and ImageNet.To do our first experiment    , we took a random 1‰ sample of the PubChem database resulting in around 48.000 chemical entities.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .Evaluation
Ideally we would like to evaluate our quality estimates against some ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases    , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Given the data types of the TPC-W benchmark    , we categorized these data types as shown in

Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .Task Description

Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.The other two measures are defined according to the standard measures to evaluate the performance of classification     , that is    , precision    , recall and F1-measure 
F 1 = 2 × P × R/P + R 11 
" performance " adopted by KDDCUP 2005 is in fact F1.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .The operative unit for stratification was the message    , and messages were assigned intact parent email together with all attachments to strata.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.D.

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.Results
SemEval-2007
Senseval-3
We also tested selectors as features over the Senseval-3 data
Examining the results in 
Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.For example    , in the New York Times front page shown in 
Structural Analysis
Our structural analysis of an HTML document is based on the key observations mentioned above.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.Word Sense Disambiguation System
The word sense disambiguation algorithm we developed is based on popular ideas from the literature 
In order to provide empirical knowledge for use by our WSD system we created a bootstrapped representation of the Brown1 document set which is part of the Semcor corpus.Reddit is also a home of subreddits like: ELIF Explain like I'm five    , TIL Today I learnt    , AMAAsk Me Anything etc.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.Stack 
Overflow.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.Reddit http://reddit.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.Three of the most accessible were the Merriam-Webster Pock& Dictionary MPD    , its larger sibling    , the Merriam-Webster Seventh Colegiate ~7 and the Longman Di@ionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method 
Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.To be considered non-rare    , a word needed to have occurred in SemCor at least once i.e.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.On Reddit    , users employ subreddits to discuss everything from crochet to conspiracy theories.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Booking.com Baseline
We use the currently live ranking method at Booking.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.Interestingly    , the most popular forum among U. S. workers is Reddit HWTF while international workers are most likely to use MTurkForum.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Animal D U : dead    , trapped    , dangerous    , unfortunate    , intact    , hungry    , wounded    , tropical    , sick    , favourite Q C : good with children  ?The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.Introduction

Methods
Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.They start out with a high comment-to-submission ratio relative to users in their cohort who abandon Reddit more quickly.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.SemCor 
Comparison systems.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified    , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.The code is available at https://github.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.Reddit allows for threaded conversations    , where users can comment over other comments.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.The rest of the order was preserved intact.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.Reddit HWTF in particular displays a variety of features e.g.An interesting feature of reddit    , is the 'throwaway account'.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.that must have her mark intact.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.The dataset in 
Characterizing affixes 
The goal of this section is to explore the types of canonical affixes users on Reddit utilize.In the Reddit dataset    , the median article received 38 votes upvotes plus downvotes    , while the median Hacker News article received 21 votes    , with a minimum of 3 votes in each case.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .It would be useful to search for objects using multiple pre-trained visual detection models    , such as a 200-class ImageNet Detection model and a 1  ,000-class ImageNet Recognition and Localisation model.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.SemEval 2007 Web People Search Results
 The best system in SemEval 2007 obtained an Fscore of 0.78    , the average F-score of all 16 participant systems is 0.60.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .The probability of generating the expansion terms is defined as 
P Q | Θ D  = |Q | q i P q i | Θ D  w i W 4 
where q i is a expansion term    , W = |Q | i=1 w i and w i is the weight we give to a expansion term    , which we can see as the relatedness between the original query Q and the expansion term    , and is computed as 
w i = P q | Q = N j=1 P q | c j P c j | Q 5 
 where c is a concept returned by the expansion algorithm     , N is the number of concepts we chose for the expansion    , P q | c j  is estimated using the sense probabilities estimated from Semcor i.e.Drexel

In the experiments described in this paper we used New York Times articles since 1870 for history.There are large numbers of tags and users; orders of magnitude larger than the 1  ,000 categories of ImageNet.It is likely that monitoring all items for sale at Walmart    , say    , is not of interest.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.This work is a preliminary exploration    , focusing on a set of high precision reddit communities    , however expanding to other subreddits is a ripe area of future research.APPENDIX
Full-life view for users in Reddit.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.New York 
Times.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.One might conjecture either that MTurkGrind has developed into an independent    , more socialized community partly from a pool of Reddit HWTF users    , or that MTurk- Grind has started to attract users from Reddit HWTF who seek more social interactions.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.The dataset is available for research at https://github.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.This realization has led various retail giants such as WalMart 
RELATED WORK
An attempt has been made to make the process of hiring an auto simpler by an initiative launched in Bangalore by the city police and the transport authority    , called Easy Auto 4 .The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.The

Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times 
Related research is briefly discussed in Section 2.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.We leave the smaller leaf intact.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Our principal argument is that simple bag-of-words based text classification models – which    , when coupled with sufficient data    , have proven to be extremely successful for many natural language processing tasks 
 We introduce the first version of the reddit irony corpus    , composed of annotated comments from the social news website reddit.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.From those terms    , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.The overall average gap is 749 days since 2008    , when users on Reddit were first allowed to create their own communities.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.The Gerbil platform already integrates the methods of Agdis- tis

Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.Answers and StackOverflow    , the Reddit dataset offers following unique advantages.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.The similarity of two graphs is defined as the Tanimoto score of their fingerprints in PubChem.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.Agency Budget and New York Times News 
2 .This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.Many alternatives to Reddit saw a substantial increase in their relative post and comment volumes; however    , the volume on Reddit was largely unchanged    , indicating that the events had minimal effect on Reddit itself.recommender systems

This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.For the user study    , we have randomly chosen 10 query entities from PubChem    , each of them representing one feedback cycle inside the system.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.The other two AMA's are open to a more wider audience for sharing their life events and allowing other reddit users to ask questions related to those events.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.To compare users' behavior on Reddit with that on the alternative platforms     , we leverage the fact that many alternatives feature subreddits with direct analogs to those seen on Reddit    , e.g.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.Rel Doc Densities

The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.The data comprises comments scraped from the social news website reddit.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.Both Reddit and Hacker News display the current score of articles    , and thus provide a signal about how other users evaluated these articles.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.All

Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.Characterizing Multi-Site Users
 Individuals cited multiple reasons for why they were motivated to leave Reddit and try a new platform.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset

Conclusions and Future work
 This paper proposes a new approach for computing word similarity between Chinese words using HowNet.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Note that as ImageNet is still a resource under development    , not all word pairs in the datasets presented in section 4 are covered.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.  , Walmart.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.The forum component of reddit is extremely active: popular posts often have well into 1000's of user comments .More information about this dataset can be found in 
The 
The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.3 We evaluate our model and features on the ImageNet hierarchies with two different taxonomy induction tasks Section 5.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.  , by ranking them    , or featuring targets on the Reddit home page.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.The source code is available at the official Github repository .  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .For each post    , Reddit provides the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.They can thus make the choice to dissociate from their reddit identity by simply using an alternate pseudonym and then leaving it behind.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor

Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.For the large dataset    , we use a real chemical compound dataset referred to here as PubChem.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users

We discuss related work in Sec.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.Status    , in both in the Reddit community as well as the RAOP subcommunity    , turns out to be strongly correlated with success.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .Consider a news website such as New York Times.Finally    , dual citizens have activity on alternatives that was sustained for longer than one week    , but their activity is not consistently higher on alternatives than Reddit.PubChem has 23.98 vertices and 25.76 edges    , on average .This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.We find this method is effective at recovering ground truth quality parameters     , and further show that it provides a good fit for Reddit and Hacker News data.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.This is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times that includes the article title    , byline    , publication date    , and URL.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.In contrast    , tourists exhibit a sudden burst in activity on Reddit alternatives and then no further activity there.Conclusion 
We have presented    , to the best of our knowledge    , the first comprehensive study of mental health discourse on the social media reddit.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.Notably    , they identify Reddit users as having a high propensity to move to alternate platforms.Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles

A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.Aleph is unable to find a good clause even after evaluating the maximum 500K clauses    , thus resulting in relatively worse performance on the WebKB-Department task than the WebKB-Student task.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.For example    , Reddit    , a famous social news site    , has mentioned in its official blog post 2 that this method is used for their ranking of comments.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.As our training corpus we opted for two available resources: SemCor and OMSTI.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.The results are shown in 
Reddit and Hacker News
Given that our model effectively recovers ground truth data from the MusicLab experiment    , we now evaluate the fit of the Poisson model to Reddit and Hacker News voting data.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.Ensemble of Classifiers
The winner of the KDDCUP 2005 competition found that the best result was achieved by combining the exact matching method and SVM.For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.Main experiments

 Introduction
Socially-curated websites such as Reddit depend on large communities for content creation and moderation 
The Reddit Controversy
 Reddit is the most popular exemplar 1 of a class of websites known as social content aggregators    , on which users can post new content as well as vote and comment on each other's content.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.However we cannot directly estimate the probability of receiving a vote versus not receiving a vote    , for both Reddit and Hacker News.Second    , posting is not affected by a confounding factor that commenting is subject to: Reddit influences commenting by how it presents potential targets for comments e.g.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.The third dataset is the second largest in Wikia    , Muppet    , whose articles are about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Our data starts in October 2007    , but Reddit existed before that.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan

Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Zhu    , Kraut    , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.Category

For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Third    , the way that comments are presented on Reddit makes scraping the complete commenting history rather difficult.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.electric current."TPC-W Query Execution

KNOWITALL was inspired    , in part    , by the WebKB project 
KNOWITALL
 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.This research reveals how social media like reddit are fulfilling unique information and social needs of a cohort challenged with a stigmatic health concern looking through the lenses of disclosure    , social support    , and disinhibition.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Results

The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.In the reddit dataset    , the responder in each IAmA is a single notable personality with average reply rate of around 10.16%.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.By mapping these communities     , when a user posts to an alternative    , we can identify how popular the corresponding subreddit would be on Reddit .  , features 7–12 in 
Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.To address this problem we used the PubChem SQL dump to store all entity data in a file based hash map.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Our claim that retrieval schedules are kept intact under this rule is a direct consequence of Equation 4.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The quality of Reddit article is estimated as: 
Q i = λ sub · e qi · r up i − r down i  3 
We include the subscript in the λ sub term to emphasize that this constant is different across subreddits.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.Reddit and each of the remaining 21 alternative platforms were crawled for all publicly available content.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.PubChem consists of 1 million graphs and is a subset of the PubChem chemical structure database 4 .Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the

The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.The comparative results are shown in

For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.Since we lack the ability to evaluate against ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News    , we evaluate this model on data from the MusicLab experiment.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.Experimental Data

The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.  , PubChem    , social networks e.g.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor    , this is representative of the current state of the art systems
Topic Distillation.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.
