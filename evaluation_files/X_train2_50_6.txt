In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.On Reddit    , over half of articles were discarded because they appeared for less than an hour in the range of positions studied.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.The relationships between atomic formulae discovered from the UMLS are converted to their propositional equivalents.We observe similar trends in Quora.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.Medical domain knowledge is developed by several different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System UMLS.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.Creating individual preprocessing rules for each repository in the collection is not a scalable solution for OAIster    , or any other large metadata collection.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.In 
Binding
Now    , given a query word wi    , we need to find the erroneous variants from the OCRed corpus.Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.In second run    , we used only single terms exist in UMLS.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.Prior literature in biomedical WSD uses older versions of UMLS data    , e.g.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     , 
where sgt is the word embedding vector of term t learned by the SkipGram algorithm

SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.Introduction
Temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different SemEval tasks 
Related work
 The present work is closely related to previous approaches involved in TempEval campaigns 
TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering
In the SemEval task 4 TimeLine: Cross-Document Event Ordering 
Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.We identified synonyms using a combination of tools from the UMLS.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.For the UMLS CUI indexes    , however    , some additional processing was required.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.The annotators unified their schemes by consensus into a hierarchical scheme with 6 coarse-grained and 31 fine-grained motivational factors additional details available at networkdynamics.org/pubs/2016/reddit-exodus/.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.EXPERIMENTS
Data Sets and Distance Functions
 We employ three image data sets: CoPhIR    , SIFT    , ImageNet     , and several data sets created from textual data.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.The conceptual indexing of queries and documents is based on using UMLS concepts.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.Word similarity judgment For similarity judgment correlations    , we selected two existing benchmarks that have the largest vocabulary overlap with our data: MEN 3K 
Single-word image retrieval 
 In order to visualize the acquired meaning for individual words    , we use images from the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet 
Sentence structure
In the following experiments    , we examine the knowledge of sentence structure learned by IMAG- INET    , and its impact on the model performance on image and paraphrase retrieval.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.We selected all French/English single words from the UMLS 6 meta-thesaurus.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.While discerning ironic comments on reddit is our immediate task    , the proposed approach is generally applicable to a wide-range of subjective     , web-based text classification tasks.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.We also used private messaging PM features on Reddit and Voat to solicit participation from randomly-selected users.Future Directions for OAIster
The University of Michigan intends to continue researching the use of OAI in a variety of ways.Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.In this paper    , we construct a dataset from Reddit and present the first large-scale study on the coexistence of highly related communities.Additional Information from UMLS 
Besides supplying CUIs for identifying synonyms of terms    , the UMLS Metathesaurus provides other information that can be used when preparing sets of query terms.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.The semantic types in UMLS are based on categories such as organisms and chemicals.We define a video to be " discovered " on Reddit if it's score was in the top 10% of scores of posts to r/videos in 2012.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.If a phrase that contained a number of UMLS strings was to appear in the report text    , such as " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation    , " it would be tagged in this case as containing five different UMLS concepts: " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. "Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.University of Amsterdam Team

This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.on the Xanga dataset.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.We find that positivity of feedback in Reddit    , the difference in upvotes and downvotes may play a substantial role    , as shown by the figure below.Historic Newspaper Collection
The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.a free-text inverted index and several UMLS CUI indexes.This was achieved using publicly available database of medical terms called UMLS Metathesaurus.Given a pair of UMLS concepts    , YTEX can produce knowledge based and distributional based similarity measures.The resulting top concepts were converted to terms as in query expansion with UMLS Metathesaurus.In 
Stability of Quora topics 
 In this section    , we shall perform stability analysis of the popular topics.REFERENCES
 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.We are encouraged by our method's ability to recover ground truth from the MusicLab experiment but we recognize that although Reddit and Hacker News are similar in some ways    , they are fundamentally different.By way of this feature    , reddit enables an individual create accounts in a matter of minutes without giving out an email address.This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.By distributing tasks or questions to large numbers of Internet users    , these " crowd-sourcing " systems have done everything from answering user questions Quora    , to translating books    , creating 3-D photo tours

CROWDTURFING OVERVIEW
 In this section    , we introduce the core concepts related to crowdturfing .Reddit Reddit is composed of many different subcommunities called " subreddits " .14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.Surveys were first posted publicly to communities on Reddit    , Voat    , Hubski    , Empeopled    , Snapzu    , Stacksity    , Piroot    , HackerNews    , Linkibl    , SaidWho and Qetzl.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.Harvested metadata that has no corresponding digital resource is not indexed in OAIster.This enriched metadata could then be distributed to meet the needs of access services    , preservation repositories    , and external aggregation services such as OAIster.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .To analyze our results further    , we grouped the query terms into three classes: 1 chunk terms obtained from the output of LT CHUNKER    , 2 UMLS terms recognized by MetaMap and    , 3 synonyms of the UMLS terms.Estimation Accuracy: We compare our CLA size estimators with a systematic excerpt 
End-to-End Experiments
 To study end-to-end CLA benefits    , we ran several algorithms over subsets of Mnist480m and ImageNet.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.UMLS provides a hierarchy between concepts through several relations including narrower than    , synonymous to    , and others.Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS
For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 
WWW 
NDCGπ    , L@K = 1 GK L K X i=1 2 Lπ −1 i − 1 logi + 1 12 where Lπ −1 i
 is the relevance level of the document with rank i in π    , and GK L is a normalizing constant that ensures that a perfect ordering has an NDCG value of 1.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.OAIster can be found online at http://www.oaister.org/    , with over a million records available from over 140 institutions.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.Evaluation
Ideally we would like to evaluate our quality estimates against some ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was funded in part by the EUSES Consortium via NSF ITR-0325273 and by NSF under Grants CCF-0438929 and CCF-0613823.UMLS
The Unified Medical Language System metathesaurus UMLS is a near-comprehensive list of biomedical concepts.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.The UMLS Semantic Network was also included in the Semantic Web.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .We will refer to this version as UMLS-CUI-sen. Once the four versions of the concept documents are obtained     , we build the four corresponding UMLS-CUI indexes using Indri.Each scanned document was run through OCR; there are 646 documents whose OCRed text was hand-corrected.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth

.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .Maybe the synonyms in UMLS are not very relevant to this particular task.A clinical semantic knowledge is established from these terms extracted by matching UMLS.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.The other two measures are defined according to the standard measures to evaluate the performance of classification     , that is    , precision    , recall and F1-measure 
F 1 = 2 × P × R/P + R 11 
" performance " adopted by KDDCUP 2005 is in fact F1.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.As a case study    , we collect a Chinese hotel review dataset from booking.com.In the following    , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.D. Findings 
 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.Results

We also tested selectors as features over the Senseval-3 data
Examining the results in 
Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Reddit is also a home of subreddits like: ELIF Explain like I'm five    , TIL Today I learnt    , AMAAsk Me Anything etc.Word Sense Disambiguation System
The word sense disambiguation algorithm we developed is based on popular ideas from the literature 
In order to provide empirical knowledge for use by our WSD system we created a bootstrapped representation of the Brown1 document set which is part of the Semcor corpus.Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.The results of RankSVM    , RankBoost    , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.Reddit http://reddit.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.Weights of report concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.,b1n .Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.Each UMLS atom may have multiple semantic types and possibly multiple semantic groups.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.2. candidates: A possibly empty list of UMLS candidate concepts identified in the phrase.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.f Xanga web-link categories

We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.To be considered non-rare    , a word needed to have occurred in SemCor at least once i.e.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest.We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.During the parsing of the XML file    , the system calculates features for every word    , line    , paragraph    , and page of the OCRed text.On Reddit    , users employ subreddits to discuss everything from crochet to conspiracy theories.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.The corresponding UMLS concepts were added as a case feature.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.Pinterest incorporates social networking features to allow users to connect with other users with similar interests.Booking.com Baseline
We use the currently live ranking method at Booking.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.User query strings were extracted by automated means from a sample of OAIster transaction logs recorded a few days each month over several months in 2003 and 2004.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.Interestingly    , the most popular forum among U. S. workers is Reddit HWTF while international workers are most likely to use MTurkForum.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.The Topic Model
In this paper we use the topic model for subject metadata enrichment of the OAIster collection.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.Query Expansion
UMLS Related Terms Query Expansion
The UMLS metathesaurus contains a couple of large tables that relate concepts to one another.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.Introduction

Methods
Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.They start out with a high comment-to-submission ratio relative to users in their cohort who abandon Reddit more quickly.However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.SemCor 
Comparison systems.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.The baseline system is not sufficient to her 
UMLS and MetaMap
The UMLS UMLS    , 2012    , or Unified Medical Language System    , is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Data Description
We used the Letor 2 data collection 
Evaluation Measures
 In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms     , three evaluation measures are applied: Precision    , Mean average precision and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain 
18 
Mean Average Precision.Note that composite concept terms only appear in the UMLS ontology i.e.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.Second    , we mapped the concepts to their SNOMED-CT equivalents using the UMLS Meta-thesaurus.Reddit allows for threaded conversations    , where users can comment over other comments.A UMLS term was considered to be negated 
After lemmatizing the UMLS strings using the GATE stemmer    , we used a trie containing all the UMLS strings with their associated concept IDs to identify exact matches of these strings in the lemmatized corpus and to store the concept IDs for indexing.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.  , Pinterest by ind resp.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.20mg while the remaining half were medical terms that are not in UMLS.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.Reddit HWTF in particular displays a variety of features e.g.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.An interesting feature of reddit    , is the 'throwaway account'.According to a recent survey made by Technorati

The metadata OAIster collects is in Simple Dublin Core format.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.The dataset in 
Characterizing affixes 
The goal of this section is to explore the types of canonical affixes users on Reddit utilize.In the Reddit dataset    , the median article received 38 votes upvotes plus downvotes    , while the median Hacker News article received 21 votes    , with a minimum of 3 votes in each case.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?It would be useful to search for objects using multiple pre-trained visual detection models    , such as a 200-class ImageNet Detection model and a 1  ,000-class ImageNet Recognition and Localisation model.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.We preprocessed the OAIster collection to produce the bag-of-words representation as follows: Starting with the 668 repositories in the 9/2/2006 harvest    , we excluded 163 primarily non-English repositories    , and 117 small repositories containing fewer than 500 records    , leaving 388 repositories.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.SemEval 2007 Web People Search Results
 The best system in SemEval 2007 obtained an Fscore of 0.78    , the average F-score of all 16 participant systems is 0.60.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .The probability of generating the expansion terms is defined as 
P Q | Θ D  = |Q | q i P q i | Θ D  w i W 4 
where q i is a expansion term    , W = |Q | i=1 w i and w i is the weight we give to a expansion term    , which we can see as the relatedness between the original query Q and the expansion term    , and is computed as 
w i = P q | Q = N j=1 P q | c j P c j | Q 5 
 where c is a concept returned by the expansion algorithm     , N is the number of concepts we chose for the expansion    , P q | c j  is estimated using the sense probabilities estimated from Semcor i.e.Thus    , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line    , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts.While this method has some advantages    , it still doesn't yield ground truth quality data for Reddit or Hacker News because the recruited population is unlikely to match the relevant population of users on Hacker News or Reddit.We further augment the dictionary with terms of interest that are not present in FOLDOC    , in particular    , topics addressed by W3C standards.There are large numbers of tags and users; orders of magnitude larger than the 1  ,000 categories of ImageNet.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.pins for majority to appear 
PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.This work is a preliminary exploration    , focusing on a set of high precision reddit communities    , however expanding to other subreddits is a ripe area of future research.APPENDIX
Full-life view for users in Reddit.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.are not annotated with concepts from the UMLS    , however they are kept for logical formula conversion.We first extracted all of the UMLS terms that appeared in the query.Therefore    , we adopt the UMLS Metathesaurus to expand the concepts.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.One might conjecture either that MTurkGrind has developed into an independent    , more socialized community partly from a pool of Reddit HWTF users    , or that MTurk- Grind has started to attract users from Reddit HWTF who seek more social interactions.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.Xanga.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.To measure the relevance between UMLS concepts    , we used personalized PageRank PPR on an ontology graph constructed with a subset of the UMLS concepts.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.The goal is to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of the UMLS Metathesaurus based query translation strategies .In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.UMLS Synonym Finder
SCDA used UMLS to augment our symptoms field with their synonyms in both the query frame and our document frames.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.The 
MRD used is The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
LDOCE.Experimental Setup
For our input dictionary we use the Unified Medical Language System UMLS.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Our principal argument is that simple bag-of-words based text classification models – which    , when coupled with sufficient data    , have proven to be extremely successful for many natural language processing tasks 
 We introduce the first version of the reddit irony corpus    , composed of annotated comments from the social news website reddit.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.The overall average gap is 749 days since 2008    , when users on Reddit were first allowed to create their own communities.moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics.The Gerbil platform already integrates the methods of Agdis- tis 
Results
Results of the experiments run on the Gerbil platform are shown in 
Discussion.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.Answers and StackOverflow    , the Reddit dataset offers following unique advantages.For example if we query the UMLS for the term heart we find that heart has a total of 5 concepts from the UMLS.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.Patient summaries were mapped to UMLS codes using MetaMap.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.The UMLS only includes " ImmunoPrecipitation " and " Immune Precipitation " .For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Many alternatives to Reddit saw a substantial increase in their relative post and comment volumes; however    , the volume on Reddit was largely unchanged    , indicating that the events had minimal effect on Reddit itself.recommender systems

This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.UMLS semantic network and Metathesaurus are extracted.UMLS Term Labeling
Building on the work of Nadkarni    , we also identified terms from the Universal Medical Language System UMLS that appeared in the reports.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.The other two AMA's are open to a more wider audience for sharing their life events and allowing other reddit users to ask questions related to those events.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.To compare users' behavior on Reddit with that on the alternative platforms     , we leverage the fact that many alternatives feature subreddits with direct analogs to those seen on Reddit    , e.g.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.The remaining words ill LDOCE is expected to be defined ill the next defining cycle.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.The data comprises comments scraped from the social news website reddit.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Thus    , creating consistent enriched subject metadata is one of the biggest challenges of the OAIster collection.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.One is the Unified Medical Language System UMLS 
UMLS contains a very large dictionary of biomedical terms – the UMLS Metathesaurus and defines a hierarchy of semantic types – the UMLS Semantic Network.All classes of UMLS concepts recognized by MetaMap were used.SemRep identifies relationships between UMLS concepts in text within the sentences.These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.Both Reddit and Hacker News display the current score of articles    , and thus provide a signal about how other users evaluated these articles.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.The Ionosphere data set analysis the quality of a radar returns from ionosphere.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in

 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.In order to obtain the graph structure of UMLS    , we simply treat the concepts in UMLS as vertices    , and the relations listed in the MRREL and MRCOC tables as edges.MetaMap was applied for the identification of UMLS concepts in visits.Experiment and Evaluation
Dataset
Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.Characterizing Multi-Site Users
 Individuals cited multiple reasons for why they were motivated to leave Reddit and try a new platform.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset 
Experimental Results

'2.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.These rankings reveal whether long-tail Reddit content is accessible on the alternative in its most popular commu- nities.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.For all runs    , FOLDOC was used in the query analysis process for query expansion.Multiple Formats 
Similarly    , a digital document may exist in different media types    , such as plain text    , HTML    , I&TEX    , DVI    , postscript    , scanned-image    , OCRed text    , or certain PC-a.pplication format.The tool that transforms OAIster metadata from Simple Dublin Core to our native DLXS Bibliographic Class was modified so that it could ingest the file from the first step    , and output a transformed metadata record.Next    , the chart parser is used to analyse the LDOCE definition of an 'ammeter'    , which is that it "is an instrument for measuring .We run experiments for several choices of V : parts-of-speech    , the 100 most frequent words in Reddit    , and the 500 most frequent words in Reddit.BIB 
Questions were put to us concerning the accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes.  , the UMLS dataset we use in the experiment have less than 1% positive triples.Differences in Social Support 
Does the nature of feedback or social support from the greater reddit community also differ in the case of posts from anonymous accounts  ?When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.SemEval Keyphrase Extraction Data
In addition to our four collections of index terms    , we used an existing dataset for keyphrase extraction evaluation — the SemEval-2010 keyphrase extraction data.Relation classification
Experimental settings
 To examine the usefulness of the dataset and distributed representations for a different application    , we address the task of relation classification on the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset 
Results and discussions
Table 3 presents the macro-averaged F1 scores on the SemEval 2010 Task 8 dataset.Evaluation
To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.We take as our benchmark the SemEval-2012 task on Measuring Degrees of Relational Similarity 
Model 
Comparison systems.We take migration to be a substantial shift in activity    , wherein the user's smoothed activity is higher on alternatives than on Reddit for at least two weeks.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.We also identified synonyms using UMLS and added them to the query.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.Next    , we generate the XML format for our annotated corpus    , which is similar to the data format in SemEval-10 Task 10.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.One is the absolute value of antonyms experimental result denoting antonymous degree that is shown in

Conclusions and Future work
 This paper proposes a new approach for computing word similarity between Chinese words using HowNet.Note that as ImageNet is still a resource under development    , not all word pairs in the datasets presented in section 4 are covered.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.Technorati.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.Queries for UMLS-CUI indexes
We created three versions of queries for UMLS-CUI indexes as follows: 1.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.Using Neo4j    , a graph building API for Java    , we constructed a graph of UMLS    , where the nodes were concepts and the edges were relationships from the UMLS related terms table.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.The forum component of reddit is extremely active: popular posts often have well into 1000's of user comments .We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .More information about this dataset can be found in 
The 
The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.3 We evaluate our model and features on the ImageNet hierarchies with two different taxonomy induction tasks Section 5.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.  , by ranking them    , or featuring targets on the Reddit home page.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.The unique feature of OAIster is that it provides access to metadata pointing to actual digital resources.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.The second synonym was obtained from UMLS.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.For each post    , Reddit provides the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Section 5 describes how the UMLS can be applied to semantic matching.They can thus make the choice to dissociate from their reddit identity by simply using an alternate pseudonym and then leaving it behind.For this we have detailed the steps involved and how the UMLS can be used.We have used the 2008AA version of the UMLS in all of our experiments.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor 
Results
On the SemEval-2007 data set    , the basic configuration of simplified Lesk SL+0—i.e.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .Craigslist.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.For English    , both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the MFS.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.UMLS Network Query Expansion
This technique represents perhaps our most unique approach to this problem.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.Textbased searches benefit from relevant descriptive keywords drawn from available ontologies within the UMLS Metathesaurus 4 .To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.Synonyms of these genes were retrieved from UMLS.In comparison    , Reddit HWTF    , MTurkGrind    , and MTurk- Forum appear to be mostly dedicated to discussions about details of MTurk work.This pipeline is based on Lavrenko's relevance models 
Query and Document Expansion with UMLS
 We also experimented with several approaches to query and document expansion using UMLS.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.ok200706301185791252056 "     , what you get is a profile which is built runtime by querying all the data sources on the web which are indexed by Sindice 5 .Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.We filter the Concepts based on information we have available from the UMLS.Weights of query concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.This functionality is only possible if we have reliable    , consistent and appropriate subject metadata for each of the ten million records in OAIster.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.Status    , in both in the Reddit community as well as the RAOP subcommunity    , turns out to be strongly correlated with success.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.Finally    , dual citizens have activity on alternatives that was sustained for longer than one week    , but their activity is not consistently higher on alternatives than Reddit.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.We find this method is effective at recovering ground truth quality parameters     , and further show that it provides a good fit for Reddit and Hacker News data.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS
Comparison of NDCG-Annealing Algorithm with Baselines in LETOR 3.0
We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.In contrast    , tourists exhibit a sudden burst in activity on Reddit alternatives and then no further activity there.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.Conclusion 
We have presented    , to the best of our knowledge    , the first comprehensive study of mental health discourse on the social media reddit.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.Notably    , they identify Reddit users as having a high propensity to move to alternate platforms.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.We would like to improve the search and discovery experience on OAIster by allowing users to restrict search results by subject.Xanga treats email addresses differently: users can provide their email address to Xanga    , and visitors can use the website to send email    , without the address being visible directly.To study the effect of q which is the length of NBC for each projected dimension    , we evaluate our MH methods on 22K LabelMe and 100K TinyImage by setting the q to three different values 2    , 3    , and 4.We recruited via Reddit 5  more than 2000 volunteers to install our extension.MatchedAnswer – The frequency of the matched UMLS semantic categories..To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.We use the Gerbil testing platform 
Evaluation metrics.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.Pinterest

 Introduction
Socially-curated websites such as Reddit depend on large communities for content creation and moderation 
The Reddit Controversy
 Reddit is the most popular exemplar 1 of a class of websites known as social content aggregators    , on which users can post new content as well as vote and comment on each other's content.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.We also explored several query expansion strategies based on the UMLS metathesaurus.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.These facts in their logical forms denoted as F UMLS  and rules denoted as R UMLS  are used to infer relations between two terms.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.However we cannot directly estimate the probability of receiving a vote versus not receiving a vote    , for both Reddit and Hacker News.bl1  ,bl2  ,.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.Second    , posting is not affected by a confounding factor that commenting is subject to: Reddit influences commenting by how it presents potential targets for comments e.g.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.The UMLS semantic network describes semantic relations such as causes between two semantic types.LabelMe 4 .MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.The UMLS Metathesaurus is used as the knowledge-base    , and we represent UMLS as a graph.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.Our data starts in October 2007    , but Reddit existed before that.Moreover    , NLP tools for utilizing the information from UMLS have been developed.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.Lexvo 
Results and Discussion
 This paper presented preliminaries for the development of a generic OWL/DLbased formalism for the representation of linguistic corpora.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.MetaMap only identifies UMLS concepts    , which are then mapped to SNOMED CT concepts.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.UMLS ® terms are recognized and expanded with their synonyms.Procedure
For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.The weights of DNN are learned on ILSVRC-2010 1     , which is a subset of ImageNet 2 dataset with 1.26 million training images from 1  ,000 categories.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.Third    , the way that comments are presented on Reddit makes scraping the complete commenting history rather difficult.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.However    , many the expansions provided by UMLS consist of phrasal expressions e.g. "To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.electric current."The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.This research reveals how social media like reddit are fulfilling unique information and social needs of a cohort challenged with a stigmatic health concern looking through the lenses of disclosure    , social support    , and disinhibition.In the reddit dataset    , the responder in each IAmA is a single notable personality with average reply rate of around 10.16%.Our hypothesis is that performance will improve by expanding queries using synonyms from UMLS.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains CUIs that arise from source ontologies     , which maintain hierarchical relationships between concepts.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.By mapping these communities     , when a user posts to an alternative    , we can identify how popular the corresponding subreddit would be on Reddit .The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com

Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.For Part B    , we filtered out the CHEM group for the UMLS concept text but not from the UMLS CUIs.As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.The quality of Reddit article is estimated as: 
Q i = λ sub · e qi · r up i − r down i  3 
We include the subscript in the λ sub term to emphasize that this constant is different across subreddits.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.We used part of UMLS hierarchy weights P@10 Avg.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.Reddit and each of the remaining 21 alternative platforms were crawled for all publicly available content.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the 
 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology

User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.Types of relations that SemRep identifies is pre-defined by the UMLS.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.Collaborating with other projects that could benefit from using OAIster    , e.g.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors

CONCLUSIONS
 This paper presents the neighbourhood preserving quantization NPQ method for approximate similarity search.On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.Despite the hysteria concerning a mass exodus from Reddit    , our behavior trend analysis shows that no such exodus occurred    , though a small user migration was apparent.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained

The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.We would also like to thank the University of Michigan for the sample of OAIster transaction log data used in our analyses.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.Since we lack the ability to evaluate against ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News    , we evaluate this model on data from the MusicLab experiment.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.The patents refer to 1291 UMLS concepts.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.UMLS is an ontology of mostly medical terms called atoms.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor    , this is representative of the current state of the art systems
Topic Distillation.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
