In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.The source code is available at the official Github repository .In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.7 GDELT covers a " cross-section of all major international    , national    , regional    , local    , and hyper-local news sources    , both print and broadcast    , from nearly every corner of the globe " 8 including major international news sources.gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.We find a significantly high correlation between the news geographies of ER and GDELT œÅ=0.867    , p=1.896e-74.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.The Shi3ld-LDP prototype with internal SPARQL endpoint embeds the KGRAM/Corese 26 engine 
Billion Triple Challenge 2012 Dataset 27 
.GDELT contains a set of entities for each article ; however    , we ignored these annotations and solely relied on our own methods to extract and disambiguate entities.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.To study the effect of q which is the length of NBC for each projected dimension    , we evaluate our MH methods on 22K LabelMe and 100K TinyImage by setting the q to three different values 2    , 3    , and 4.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .We use GDELT    , currently the largest global event catalog    , to automatically discover relevant events with high MSM coverage.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.Douban    , launched on March 6    , 2005    , is a Chinese Web 2.0 web site providing user rating    , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in

B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Examples of such data include GDELT gdeltproject .org and Recorded Future www.recordedfuture.com.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in 
DISCUSSION
 In order to gain more intuition on which cases TSA approach should be applied    , we provide real examples of the strengths and weaknesses of our methods compared to the state of the art ESA method.Then    , we extract all the unique URLs corresponding to events annotated in GDELT with one of these themes for each day.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.GitHub Watchers.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.GDELT indexes documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average    , whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.The dataset is available for research at https://github.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman œÅ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.To locate the URLs corresponding to news articles relevant to climate change    , we rely on GDELT themes and taxonomies    , which are topical tags that automatically annotate events.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times more documents than ER does per day.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.The code is available at https://github.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Given the data types of the TPC-W benchmark    , we categorized these data types as shown in 
Costs.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors 
Projection Methods
 We evaluate NPQ quantisation performance with five projection schemes: LSH-based projections 
Baselines
NPQ quantisation performance is compared against four state-of-the-art quantisation schemes in addition to the standard threshold at zero technique: single bit quantisation SBQ

CONCLUSIONS
 This paper presents the neighbourhood preserving quantization NPQ method for approximate similarity search.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Douban is a Chinese Web 2.0 Web site providing user rating     , review and recommendation services for movies    , books and music.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.System under Test

B.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.GDELT releases data about daily media coverage in two formats: the Event Database and the Global Knowledge Graph GKG.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.However    , given that we are interested in the peak in the coverage    , rather than in the number of events    , here we directly use the news articles    , not the events automatically mapped by GDELT; applying a consistent methodology for detecting events.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.In our analysis of GitHub

 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.We used GDELT http://gdeltproject.org/ news dataset for our experiments.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers 
TPC-W Benchmark

Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from 63  ,268 websites    , and ER from 20  ,754 websites.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.LabelMe 4 .This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.The Ionosphere data set analysis the quality of a radar returns from ionosphere.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.What we learned from this study is that we should carefully use GDELT and ER for research because the two datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news sources.WWW2003    ,

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.To systematically identify all the GDELT themes and taxonomies that are related to climate change we first built the co-occurrence graph among them.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.Prior Interaction ‚Äì Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.We use the Comparison between GDELT and ER Scale One of the most important criteria for the comparison is the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehensive the dataset is.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.Validation Survey Respondents
