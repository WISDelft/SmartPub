Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.To do so    , we test against three publicly available image datasets: 22k Labelme consisting of 22  ,019 images represented as 512 dimensional Gist descriptors

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query.For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.SUDS overall accuracy is reported at 62.1% when evaluated using the Brown2 part of SemCor    , this is representative of the current state of the art systems

METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.LabelMe 4 .The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.The resuiting TDT corpus includes 15  ,863 news stories spanning July 1    , 1994    , through June 30    , 1995.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .Evaluation
To evaluate TagAssist    , we used data provided to use by Technorati    , a leading authority in blog search and aggregation.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC 
Evaluation Measures
TDT project has its own evaluation plan.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Semantic Search Engine

EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

" performance " adopted by KDDCUP 2005 is in fact F1.Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book;

Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.Evaluation
 Our final run on the evaluation portion of TDT-2 produced 146 clusters.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.The probability of generating the expansion terms is defined as 
P Q | Θ D  = |Q | q i P q i | Θ D  w i W 4 
where q i is a expansion term    , W = |Q | i=1 w i and w i is the weight we give to a expansion term    , which we can see as the relatedness between the original query Q and the expansion term    , and is computed as 
w i = P q | Q = N j=1 P q | c j P c j | Q 5 
 where c is a concept returned by the expansion algorithm     , N is the number of concepts we chose for the expansion    , P q | c j  is estimated using the sense probabilities estimated from Semcor i.e.Datasets

Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u.

Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.Consider all the suggested queries QTDT     , TP  that are    , both in the list that is dwelled for no shorter than TDT     , and    , ranked at positions no lower than TP dwell time ≥ TDT and position ≤ TP .2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.The results of RankSVM    , RankBoost    , AdaRank and FRank are reported in the Letor data set.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.Experimental results    , obtained using the LETOR benchmark    , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     ,

We have proposed a vocabulary    , SCOVO    , and discussed good practice guidelines for publishing statistical data on the Web in this paper.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.Conclusion
 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.SemCor 
Comparison systems.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.To study the effect of q which is the length of NBC for each projected dimension    , we evaluate our MH methods on 22K LabelMe and 100K TinyImage by setting the q to three different values 2    , 3    , and 4.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.According to a recent survey made by Technorati 
RCS ARCHITECTURE
INCREMENTAL STORY CLUSTERING
Note the daily crawled data could be treated as a data stream.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.Ensemble of Classifiers
The winner of the KDDCUP 2005 competition found that the best result was achieved by combining the exact matching method and SVM.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.precision = P C
Implementation
 The collection used in the experiments is part of TDT- 3 1 .We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .As our training corpus we opted for two available resources: SemCor and OMSTI.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.Technorati.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF..Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.Word Sense Disambiguation System
The word sense disambiguation algorithm we developed is based on popular ideas from the literature 
In order to provide empirical knowledge for use by our WSD system we created a bootstrapped representation of the Brown1 document set which is part of the Semcor corpus.bl1  ,bl2  ,.Results on NASDAQ Dataset
 Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.The disambiguation system we used SUDS is based on a statistical language model constructed from the manually sense tagged Brown1 part of the Semcor corpus.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.CONCLUSION
 In this paper    , we report the observations made from popular queries published by Technorati over one year period.  , using statistical natural language processing and/or by relying on white-lists provided by vigilante groups    , such as Technorati.OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.,b1n .Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.For LabelMe image database    , it contains more than 25  ,000 images and our experiments are done on a snapshot of this database downloaded at April 2006.LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 
.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.To provide a benchmark for the performance of our automated WSD system we used it to disambiguate the Brown2 part of Semcor.The data provided by AcroMed 4     , LocusLink 5     , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.
