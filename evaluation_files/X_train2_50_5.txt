In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .The relationships between atomic formulae discovered from the UMLS are converted to their propositional equivalents.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.Medical domain knowledge is developed by several different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System UMLS.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.In 
Binding
Now    , given a query word wi    , we need to find the erroneous variants from the OCRed corpus.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.In second run    , we used only single terms exist in UMLS.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Prior literature in biomedical WSD uses older versions of UMLS data    , e.g.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     , 
where sgt is the word embedding vector of term t learned by the SkipGram algorithm 
bm d tq = arg max t d ∈d simtq    , t d  bmqt d  = arg max tq ∈q simtq    , t d  δst    , d = simt    , bm d t 
δsq    , t = simbmqt    , t     , 4 Term repetition is avoided since the number of occurrences of the term t in d is already counted in fL i .Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.We identified synonyms using a combination of tools from the UMLS.For the UMLS CUI indexes    , however    , some additional processing was required.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.TripAdvisor 2 for vacation trip planning    , and we assume that one such tool has been employed.1 We obtained 1  ,212  ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86  ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25  ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 .The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.The conceptual indexing of queries and documents is based on using UMLS concepts.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.In the end    , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.We selected all French/English single words from the UMLS 6 meta-thesaurus.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.The BLOG06 collection contains approximately 100k feed documents    , which are a mix of ATOM and RSS XML.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Additional Information from UMLS 
Besides supplying CUIs for identifying synonyms of terms    , the UMLS Metathesaurus provides other information that can be used when preparing sets of query terms.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.The semantic types in UMLS are based on categories such as organisms and chemicals.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."Blog search engines such as Technorati have introduced new features enabling people to find authoritative feeds on a given topic.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .What we learned from this study is that we should carefully use GDELT and ER for research because the two datasets are quite different in terms of scale and news sources.GitHub Watchers.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.If a phrase that contained a number of UMLS strings was to appear in the report text    , such as " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation    , " it would be tagged in this case as containing five different UMLS concepts: " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. "Such behavior of hiding consumer reviews has been reported several times in

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.We find a significantly high correlation between the news geographies of ER and GDELT ρ=0.867    , p=1.896e-74.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.on the Xanga dataset.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.Historic Newspaper Collection
The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.As future work    , we intend to evaluate the impact of the service in the expansion of BDBComp as well as on its sustainability.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink 
CONCEPT EXTRACTION.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.a free-text inverted index and several UMLS CUI indexes.This was achieved using publicly available database of medical terms called UMLS Metathesaurus.Given a pair of UMLS concepts    , YTEX can produce knowledge based and distributional based similarity measures.Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.The resulting top concepts were converted to terms as in query expansion with UMLS Metathesaurus.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.Bio2RDF dataset vocabularies and their SIO-mappings are stored in separate OWL ontologies on the bio2rdf-mapping GitHub repository 8 .Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.3 How would you grade your knowledge of bibliographic self-archiving after using the BDBComp service  ?Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .To analyze our results further    , we grouped the query terms into three classes: 1 chunk terms obtained from the output of LT CHUNKER    , 2 UMLS terms recognized by MetaMap and    , 3 synonyms of the UMLS terms.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.UMLS provides a hierarchy between concepts through several relations including narrower than    , synonymous to    , and others.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS
For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 
WWW 
NDCGπ    , L@K = 1 GK L K X i=1 2 Lπ −1 i − 1 logi + 1 12 where Lπ −1 i
 is the relevance level of the document with rank i in π    , and GK L is a normalizing constant that ensures that a perfect ordering has an NDCG value of 1.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.For example    , it is not meaningful to send the query " diabetes " to TripAdvisor .com    , a travel resource.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.In BDBComp see 
Effectiveness Without Any Training
To analyze the effectiveness of our method without using any training example    , we execute NC with default eters i.e.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.Technorati provided us a slice of their data from a sixteen day period in late 2006.The UMLS Semantic Network was also included in the Semantic Web.Each scanned document was run through OCR; there are 646 documents whose OCRed text was hand-corrected.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .We will refer to this version as UMLS-CUI-sen. Once the four versions of the concept documents are obtained     , we build the four corresponding UMLS-CUI indexes using Indri.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.We used a custom implementation of the algorithm    , available on GitHub.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.Dataset Description
Stack Overflow provides a periodic database dump of all user-generated content under the Creative Commons Attribute- ShareAlike 
Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.Maybe the synonyms in UMLS are not very relevant to this particular task.A clinical semantic knowledge is established from these terms extracted by matching UMLS.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.D. Findings 
 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.USER STUDY DETAILS
 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors     , such as location    , gender and age 6 .We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.To locate the URLs corresponding to news articles relevant to climate change    , we rely on GDELT themes and taxonomies    , which are topical tags that automatically annotate events.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Stack

Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.We use GDELT    , currently the largest global event catalog    , to automatically discover relevant events with high MSM coverage.,b1n .An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Weights of report concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Each UMLS atom may have multiple semantic types and possibly multiple semantic groups.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.2. candidates: A possibly empty list of UMLS candidate concepts identified in the phrase.Then    , we extract all the unique URLs corresponding to events annotated in GDELT with one of these themes for each day.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.f Xanga web-link categories

 In this paper    , we evaluate the performance for the Zipflike distribution as is used in the AS3AP benchmarks 
iz X fi = 1 conslad' 1 5 i 5 n 
In this formula    , z is the decay factor and constant' is the n-th harmonic number of order z.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.Data
The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.We provide a view of testing on GitHub as seen by a self-selected population.During the parsing of the XML file    , the system calculates features for every word    , line    , paragraph    , and page of the OCRed text.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.InLinks We assume that non-personal blogs are more likely to have a large number of incoming links than personal ones    , and use the Technorati Cosmos API 2 to obtain this number.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.The corresponding UMLS concepts were added as a case feature.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Query Expansion
UMLS Related Terms Query Expansion
The UMLS metathesaurus contains a couple of large tables that relate concepts to one another.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.TDT corpora 
Results.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.The baseline system is not sufficient to her 
UMLS and MetaMap
The UMLS UMLS    , 2012    , or Unified Medical Language System    , is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies.Data Description
We used the Letor 2 data collection 
Evaluation Measures
 In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms     , three evaluation measures are applied: Precision    , Mean average precision and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain 
18 
Mean Average Precision.Note that composite concept terms only appear in the UMLS ontology i.e.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents    , learned contemporary works    , articles from journals    , etc.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.The code is available at https://github.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.Second    , we mapped the concepts to their SNOMED-CT equivalents using the UMLS Meta-thesaurus.THE BDBCOMP ARCHITECTURE
The BDBComp architecture comprises three major layers 
THE BDBCOMP REPOSITORY
The BDBComp main repository is a relational database and has been implemented in MySQL according to the ER schema depicted in 
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 I.A UMLS term was considered to be negated 
After lemmatizing the UMLS strings using the GATE stemmer    , we used a trie containing all the UMLS strings with their associated concept IDs to identify exact matches of these strings in the lemmatized corpus and to store the concept IDs for indexing.We also discovered that GDELT indexes documents from 63  ,268 websites    , and ER from 20  ,754 websites.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection    , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 
 INTRODUCTION
A large and increasing number of people are using Web search engine to seek information today.20mg while the remaining half were medical terms that are not in UMLS.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection
Evaluation.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.According to a recent survey made by Technorati 
RCS ARCHITECTURE
INCREMENTAL STORY CLUSTERING
Note the daily crawled data could be treated as a data stream.Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.1 TripAdvisor is an ideal case study for us to explore the dynamics of language in a social medium characterized by the diversity of its participants and its huge scale    , yet that offers few opportunities for direct interaction or dialog between participants.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 
.These queries are listed in 
The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.WWW 2010  Full Paper April 26-30  Raleigh  NC  USA 
 We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including 
b    , we can see that different categories of locations are roughly differentiated by our similarity metric    , while under the baseline metric some of them are coupled together.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .Thus    , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line    , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.In LETOR 3.0 dataset    , each query can only belong to only one category.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts.We further augment the dictionary with terms of interest that are not present in FOLDOC    , in particular    , topics addressed by W3C standards.It is likely that monitoring all items for sale at Walmart    , say    , is not of interest.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.Examples of such data include GDELT gdeltproject .org and Recorded Future www.recordedfuture.com.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.are not annotated with concepts from the UMLS    , however they are kept for logical formula conversion.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.We first extracted all of the UMLS terms that appeared in the query.Therefore    , we adopt the UMLS Metathesaurus to expand the concepts.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.However    , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.Xanga.To measure the relevance between UMLS concepts    , we used personalized PageRank PPR on an ontology graph constructed with a subset of the UMLS concepts.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.The goal is to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of the UMLS Metathesaurus based query translation strategies .In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.The dataset is available for research at https://github.UMLS Synonym Finder
SCDA used UMLS to augment our symptoms field with their synonyms in both the query frame and our document frames.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.This realization has led various retail giants such as WalMart 
RELATED WORK
An attempt has been made to make the process of hiring an auto simpler by an initiative launched in Bangalore by the city police and the transport authority    , called Easy Auto 4 .On the BDBComp collection    , SAND outperformed two unsupervised methods in more than 36% under the pF1 metric and in more 4% under the K metric.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.We found that GDELT collects 2.26 times to 6.43 times more documents than ER does per day.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.The

Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.For example if we query the UMLS for the term heart we find that heart has a total of 5 concepts from the UMLS.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.7 GDELT covers a " cross-section of all major international    , national    , regional    , local    , and hyper-local news sources    , both print and broadcast    , from nearly every corner of the globe " 8 including major international news sources.Patient summaries were mapped to UMLS codes using MetaMap.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.In order to test this    , we collected articles from Technorati and compared them at a syntactic level.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.The UMLS only includes " ImmunoPrecipitation " and " Immune Precipitation " .BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.For the spots that are not found in TripAdvisor    , we will label them by hands.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.Orkut also offers friend relationship.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.For example    , Technorati 1 lists most frequently searched keywords and tags.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.Knowledge Base Population
As a result of our participation in the 2015 TAC KBP Slot Filler Validation Task    , we have accumulated an interesting dataset of 69 automatically extracted knowledge bases from all participating systems.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.UMLS semantic network and Metathesaurus are extracted.UMLS Term Labeling
Building on the work of Nadkarni    , we also identified terms from the Universal Medical Language System UMLS that appeared in the reports.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.The better results between the two runs are shown in

One entity per discourse
In order to estimate OSPD we divided the number of times a mention string referred to different entities in the document with the number of times a mention string occurred multiple times in the document.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.In this paper    , we first give an overview of the popular queries collected from Technorati http://www.technorati.com/    , a well-known blog search engine    , over one year period.The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor    , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.We used GDELT http://gdeltproject.org/ news dataset for our experiments.Rel Doc Densities

Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.Interestingly    , CMU    , the top performing group    , experimented with both types of index    , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i    , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.One is the Unified Medical Language System UMLS 
UMLS contains a very large dictionary of biomedical terms – the UMLS Metathesaurus and defines a hierarchy of semantic types – the UMLS Semantic Network.All classes of UMLS concepts recognized by MetaMap were used.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.SemRep identifies relationships between UMLS concepts in text within the sentences.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.Likewise    , a third score is computed based on the categories of TripAdvisor UT .A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.All

The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.SNOMED or UMLS seem to be better options.Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.  dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20    , selected using LocusLink information.Raw text was extracted from the XML format of the AQU- AINT-2 and Blog06 collections.with improbable movements and expr In the following part of this s&tion    , the comparison betwee~ semantic markers of LDOCE and the thesaurus constrn&ed ti:o~    , ~he definitions of nouns in LDOCE is discussed ikon~ ~;he view Nouns rdated to the concept animate have a relatively rumple st  ,nctnre in the thesaurus    , us auimat~ is often used ~s an example :d ~¢ the~uaar~_s.like system.In order to obtain the graph structure of UMLS    , we simply treat the concepts in UMLS as vertices    , and the relations listed in the MRREL and MRCOC tables as edges.MetaMap was applied for the identification of UMLS concepts in visits.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort."1'o automatically produce the thesaurus from LDOCE    , two programs have been dcveloped:

Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.BDBComp has been designed to be OAI compliant and adopts Dublin Core DC as its metadata standard.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.Queries for UMLS-CUI indexes
We created three versions of queries for UMLS-CUI indexes as follows: 1.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.From the TripAdvisor data    , we randomly sampled 650 threads.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.Using Neo4j    , a graph building API for Java    , we constructed a graph of UMLS    , where the nodes were concepts and the edges were relationships from the UMLS related terms table.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.We began by collecting the 350 most popular tags from Technorati .INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.The source code is available at the official Github repository .It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.We use the Comparison between GDELT and ER Scale One of the most important criteria for the comparison is the scale of a dataset because it describes how comprehensive the dataset is.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.The second synonym was obtained from UMLS.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.As an example of a simple system    , we could cite BDBComp Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Computação 
In existing systems    , in general    , such configurations are performed manually or via command-line scripts.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.4 This NIST policy was not made public at development time    , but we had chosen to create our own internal blog question test set from BLOG06 snippets that can serve as answers.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Section 5 describes how the UMLS can be applied to semantic matching.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.For this we have detailed the steps involved and how the UMLS can be used.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.The two metrics are as follows: 
Experimental Results
Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.We have used the 2008AA version of the UMLS in all of our experiments.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.Craigslist.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.The average blog entry in our BLOG06 index has 220 words.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .OutLinks Acting on the observation that personal blogs often have link to sites of interest to the blogger    , we also obtain the number of outgoing links of a blog using the Technorati Cosmos API.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.UMLS Network Query Expansion
This technique represents perhaps our most unique approach to this problem.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.In the following    , we argue that it is not and motivate an alternative metric for blog post credibility that we are currently prototyping in a blog search and analytics engine for news blogs on foreign relations see 
Credibility vs. authority
The Technorati 1 blog search engine calculates a measure of blog authority as the log of the number of incoming blog links over a six month period 
Measuring credibility
We are constructing a measure of blog credibility that takes into account source    , message and reception features of bloggers.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.Technorati also provides a RESTful 
USES OF TAGS
We are particularly interested in determining what uses tags have.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality     , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user-spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the personality of recommendation system.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .Textbased searches benefit from relevant descriptive keywords drawn from available ontologies within the UMLS Metathesaurus 4 .GDELT indexes documents in 64.1 different languages per day on average    , whereas ER indexes documents in 14 languages.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.Some exceptions exist    , like BibSonomy 1 bookmarks + bibtex    , sevenload 2 pictures + video    , or technorati 3 blogs + video.Synonyms of these genes were retrieved from UMLS.This pipeline is based on Lavrenko's relevance models 
Query and Document Expansion with UMLS
 We also experimented with several approaches to query and document expansion using UMLS.TripAdvisor 
– .2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.We filter the Concepts based on information we have available from the UMLS.Weights of query concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.For example    , travel sites such as TripAdvisor and TravellersPoint offer services that enable users to find hotels with particular facilities and located in particular regions.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS

 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.Her own practice in her office with digital material was almost entirely of on-screen reading from her laptop; mostly of digital journals    , but also of online scans of mediaeval material.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.Semantic Search Engine

 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .Furthermore    , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality    , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user‐spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the  Rest of the spots sorting First of all    , we sort the probability of user interest of dislike for each category in ascending way.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems

The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.UMLS concept extracted at the sentence level    , using bi-­‐directional greedy dictionary matching for noun phrases.While the definition of blog distillation as explained above is different    , the idea is to provide the users with the key blogs about 
Topics and Relevance Judgments
 For the purposes of the blog distillation task    , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC 
Evaluation Measures
TDT project has its own evaluation plan.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
 Introduction
 The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population TAC-KBP Slot Filling SF task 
1 Supervised classification.We also explored several query expansion strategies based on the UMLS metathesaurus.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.These facts in their logical forms denoted as F UMLS  and rules denoted as R UMLS  are used to infer relations between two terms.  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.bl1  ,bl2  ,.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.The UMLS semantic network describes semantic relations such as causes between two semantic types.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.The UMLS Metathesaurus is used as the knowledge-base    , and we represent UMLS as a graph.Moreover    , NLP tools for utilizing the information from UMLS have been developed.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.MetaMap only identifies UMLS concepts    , which are then mapped to SNOMED CT concepts.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.Category

For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.TDT has been more and more important.GDELT contains a set of entities for each article ; however    , we ignored these annotations and solely relied on our own methods to extract and disambiguate entities.However    , many the expansions provided by UMLS consist of phrasal expressions e.g. "The other dataset contains 200 reviews randomly selected from Tripadvisor.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.electric current."While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?Our hypothesis is that performance will improve by expanding queries using synonyms from UMLS.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains CUIs that arise from source ontologies     , which maintain hierarchical relationships between concepts.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.For Part B    , we filtered out the CHEM group for the UMLS concept text but not from the UMLS CUIs.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The current research focuses on the writing style participants use in English-language reviews of tourist attractions at TripAdvisor     , a site that prides itself on being international in scope    , operating in 34 countries.To systematically identify all the GDELT themes and taxonomies that are related to climate change we first built the co-occurrence graph among them.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.We used part of UMLS hierarchy weights P@10 Avg.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.  , Technorati Top 100 Blogs    , The Bloggies Annual Weblog Awards    , The Edublog Awards    , TIME The Best Blogs    , and Bloggeries Blog Directory.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.We selected 500 of the articles collected from Technorati and    , for each of these articles    , we extracted the three words with the top TFIDF score.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.Types of relations that SemRep identifies is pre-defined by the UMLS.LETOR 2 challenge datasets.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.In our analysis of GitHub 
II.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained 
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns 
 4 Comparison between Result of Extraction and BOX Code 
The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.The assessor then searched the Blog06 test collection to see if blog posts with relevant opinions appear in the collection.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site 
User lifespan.This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.The patents refer to 1291 UMLS concepts.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.UMLS is an ontology of mostly medical terms called atoms.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.
