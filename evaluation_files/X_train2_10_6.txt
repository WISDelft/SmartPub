Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .All

SCOVO is used in voiD    , the " Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets " 
Conclusion and Future Work
We have proposed a vocabulary    , SCOVO    , and discussed good practice guidelines for publishing statistical data on the Web in this paper.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.Besides    , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference    , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap.  , OpenStreetMap is about 300 GB.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.OpenStreetMap.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.We filter out the photos that are not located in the city by latitude and longitude boundary as shown in

One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.– Subclassing the SCOVO-Dimension class.Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.To help assess generality    , we have begun to study OpenStreetMap    , a significantly different community.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.Collaborative spatial data collection efforts     , such as OpenStreetMap 
OVERVIEW
Query Cases
There are five major categories of queries: i feature aggregation queries non-spatial queries    , for example    , queries for finding mean values of attributes or distribution of attributes; ii fundamental spatial queries    , including point based queries    , containment queries and spatial joins; iii complex spatial queries    , including spatial crossmatching or overlay large scale spatial join and nearest neighbor queries; iv integrated spatial and feature queries    , for example    , feature aggregation queries in a selected spatial regions; and v global spatial pattern queries    , for example    , queries on finding high density regions    , or queries to find directional patterns of spatial objects .Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.In particular    , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.To describe those segments    , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources 
Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario    , e.g.OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.REFERENCES
 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.The two metrics are as follows:

Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.The query thus defines a modified Location-Dependent Skyline Query as formulated by

The generated query with a runtime of 42 ms now contains a WITHIN preference for a polygon defining the administrative boundary of the 'Fatih' district as retrieved from the integrated OpenStreetMap data.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .OpenStreetMap OSM.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .ok200706301185791252056 "     , what you get is a profile which is built runtime by querying all the data sources on the web which are indexed by Sindice 5 .By collecting bread crumbs from cell phones    , social media    , and participatory platforms    , researchers will increasingly rely on data sets orders of magnitude richer than previous urban studies data sets 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank OpenStreetMap and all its contributors for making their data freely available.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Performance on OpenStreetMap Dataset
Scalability of Hadoop-GIS
Boundary Handling Overhead
We run the join query on PI dataset to measure the overhead in boundary handling step.Location is based on GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application    , and the map is based on data from the OpenStreetMap project.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data    , a restaurant guide    , etc.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.However    , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen    , available as Shapefiles 10 .With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.Road network N1 is obtained from OpenStreetMap and contain all roads    , while road network N2 is obtained from the Beijing traffic management bureau and contains only highways and main roads.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data    , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data.also the first query of the 'user' block in 
Publishing OpenStreetMap Geo Data
In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed    , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.Dataset 
OpenStreetMap.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.
