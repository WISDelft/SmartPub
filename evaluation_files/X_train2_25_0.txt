B.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.The two metrics are as follows: 
Experimental Results
Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .Users on Pinterest can copy images pinned by other users    , and " repin " onto their own pinboards.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.For each word    , we construct the time series of its occurrence in New York Times articles.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.discussing travel experiences in TripAdvisor.For example    , travel sites such as TripAdvisor and TravellersPoint offer services that enable users to find hotels with particular facilities and located in particular regions.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.When we try to fetch the profile page of a suspended identity    , Pinterest returns a 404 HTTP error message.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.The current research focuses on the writing style participants use in English-language reviews of tourist attractions at TripAdvisor     , a site that prides itself on being international in scope    , operating in 34 countries.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan 
SUMMARY OF THE METHODOLOGY
EXPERIMENTS
 We have carried out experiments on MyBenchmark using workloads from TPC-W and TPC-C benchmarks.We leverage these signals to reason about the trustworthiness of the matching identities in Pinterest.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.Social Collecting
We define a site like Pinterest    , that combines social and collecting capabilities    , as a " social collecting " website.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.USER STUDY DETAILS
 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.Creating individual preprocessing rules for each repository in the collection is not a scalable solution for OAIster    , or any other large metadata collection.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .  , Pinterest     , search frequency    , and click-through rate.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .And also the beauty of Pinterest    , is the ability to pin things from strangers.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.Therefore    , we might expect that the ability of social networks to provide access to new informationwould be important on Pinterest.Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.Images on Pinterest are called pins and can be added in one of two ways.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.OAIster can be found online at http://www.oaister.org/    , with over a million records available from over 140 institutions.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.These surrogates are then saved in personal collections    , called " pinboards " on Pinterest.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .In Section IV    , we apply PPD to the TPC-W benchmark in two different deployment environments.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.WWW2003    ,

Design Principles
Design trade-offs for our distributed TPC-W system are guided by our project goal of providing high availability and good performance for e-commerce edge services as well as by technology trends.Future Directions for OAIster
The University of Michigan intends to continue researching the use of OAI in a variety of ways.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.Professional Pinterest users were also likely to use Pinterest to support collaboration and communication.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.Collaborating with other projects that could benefit from using OAIster    , e.g.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.with improbable movements and expr In the following part of this s&tion    , the comparison betwee~ semantic markers of LDOCE and the thesaurus constrn&ed ti:o~    , ~he definitions of nouns in LDOCE is discussed ikon~ ~;he view Nouns rdated to the concept animate have a relatively rumple st  ,nctnre in the thesaurus    , us auimat~ is often used ~s an example :d ~¢ the~uaar~_s.like system.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.Generally Pinterest is used to show a more " human " side to the organization.We obtained the transcripts of both events from the New York Times 2 .In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.Each scanned document was run through OCR; there are 646 documents whose OCRed text was hand-corrected.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.Six collections    , relevant to the assignment about television and film personalities    , from various archives were indexed: 1 a television program collection containing 0.5M metadata records; 2 a photo collection with 20K photos of people working at television studio; 3 a wiki dedicated to actors and presenters 20K pages; 4 25K television guides that are scanned and OCRed; 5 scanned and OCRed newspapers between 1900 and 1995 6M articles; and 6 digital newspapers between 1995 and 2010 1M articles.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in 
Loading and preprocessing 
 the ontology.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.For the spots that are not found in TripAdvisor    , we will label them by hands.The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors     , such as location    , gender and age 6 .The data consists of the IDs of the products/services to be rated as well as the related user IDs who evaluated them with star rating scores from 1 up to 5 at different timesteps in the case of TripAdvisor    , the rating scores range from 0 up to 5.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.We automatically processed these definitions in FOLDOC and extracted    , for each term    , its acronym or expansion if the term is an acronym    , if any    , and the system's confidence that the acronym and expansion are co-referents of one another.OAIster    , a union catalog of digital resources    , harvests from over seven hundred OAI repositories i.e.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.Pinterest was founded in 2010    , and boasts a user population of 70 million as of July 2013.For example    , it is not meaningful to send the query " diabetes " to TripAdvisor .com    , a travel resource.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.The 
MRD used is The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
LDOCE.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in 
C.3 TPC-W Benchmark 
We now describe the results when testing ecStore on EC2 with TPC-W benchmark    , which models the on-line book store application workload.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.Results for the analysis of the 2  ,404 OAIster query strings are given in Tables 4 and 5 below.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.More precisely    , we analyze whether a random set of Pinterest identities a majority of which would be expected to be trustworthy have different reputation or trustworthiness scores than a set of untrustworthy Pinterest identities.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.Next    , the chart parser is used to analyse the LDOCE definition of an 'ammeter'    , which is that it "is an instrument for measuring .Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.For this    , we consider the task of curating identities in the target domain Pinterest.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.gorizing all data types as A data complies with the requirements of the TPC-W benchmark.For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.Pinterest combines the annotating features of tagging websites with the collecting and describing features of photo sharing and blogging websites.The process is sketched in

 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.Our experiments are based on the TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental setup
TPC-W benchmark.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.This turned out to be an artifact of OCRed metadata.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.Pinterest    , n.d. Pinterest is evolving as people construct collections.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.On some services like Pinterest    , users follow others unilaterally    , creating directional links.Consider a news website such as New York Times.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.TripAdvisor 
– .By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.We would also like to thank the University of Michigan for the sample of OAIster transaction log data used in our analyses.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.f Users who are influential on Pinterest    , as measured by repins    , tend to have lower copy ratios.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.For instance a user on Pinterest can pin an item    , like it or comment on it.Others    , and Evolving Interests 
It is worth noting that the infrastructure Pinterest provides for building repositories is not simply a neutral toolkit we would argue that no infrastructure is or could be; as an organization     , Pinterest promotes beauty as a defining principle for activity on the site and our interviewees shared this orientation: Pinterest lets you organize and share all the beautiful things you find on the web.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.Text Corpora 
On the one hand    , we process the ArguAna TripAdvisor corpus that we have introduced in 
Sentiment Scoring 
On the hotel reviews    , we compute the root mean squared error of linear sentiment score regression trained using stochastic gradient descent SGD from Weka 3.7.5 
Effectiveness of Modeling Argumentation
First    , we measure the theoretically possible scoring effectiveness of all feature types within one domain.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.To enable this comparison    , we selected 30K Pinterest users uniformly at random from our original sample of 2 million Pinterest users.A job folder resides in one of the four main queues: scanned    , processed    , OCRed and ready for archiving queue.This functionality is only possible if we have reliable    , consistent and appropriate subject metadata for each of the ten million records in OAIster.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.The social graph of Pinterest is created through users following other users or boards they find interesting.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Examples include Pinterest boards    , blogs    , and even collections of tweets.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.Pinterest supports these behaviors along with the associated search and retrieval tools that help users discover interesting resources and people.We recall that a Pinterest user may have several different pinboards each assigned to one of 32 globally defined categories.SEARCHING FOR PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS IN THE TPC-W BENCHMARK We use the TPC-W Benchmark 
A.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The unique feature of OAIster is that it provides access to metadata pointing to actual digital resources.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.Pinterest
Pinterest is a pinboard-style image sharing social network    , where everything is about photos and videos.Because read-only transactions do not produce this overhead at all    , the higher the ratio of update transactions become    , the bigger overhead LRM suffers 
TPC-W Benchmark
The TPC-W benchmark 
Experimental Setup
We use up to 7 replicas    , one is the leader master and the others are followers slaves for database node.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.Agency Budget and New York Times News 
2 .We refer here to ownership as experienced by Pinterest users.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.Some services incur either 271

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins and can be created in two ways.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.The Topic Model
In this paper we use the topic model for subject metadata enrichment of the OAIster collection.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.In a similar vein    , the website Pinterest allows users to annotate digital objects in their own personal collections www.pinterest.com.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.We run most of experiments with TPC-W benchmark dataset 2 .Furthermore    , the TPC-W benchmark states that all database transactions require strong consistency guarantees.During the parsing of the XML file    , the system calculates features for every word    , line    , paragraph    , and page of the OCRed text.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.11 Out of the 1.7M Pinterest identities    , we found that 74  ,549 have been suspended.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.Such behavior of hiding consumer reviews has been reported several times in

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality     , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user-spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the personality of recommendation system.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.Images posted by identities on Pinterest are called pins.The user who introduces an image into Pinterest is its pinner; others who copy onto their own pinboards are repinners.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.The follow model of Pinterest  allows users to follow pinboards i.e.1 TripAdvisor is an ideal case study for us to explore the dynamics of language in a social medium characterized by the diversity of its participants and its huge scale    , yet that offers few opportunities for direct interaction or dialog between participants.Often    , interviewees described using Pinterest to support communication and collaboration with both Pinterest users and nonusers     , who access the site in " read only " mode.We use this signal to identify suspended identities on Pinterest.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.The remaining words ill LDOCE is expected to be defined ill the next defining cycle.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.This is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times that includes the article title    , byline    , publication date    , and URL.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.We would like to improve the search and discovery experience on OAIster by allowing users to restrict search results by subject.See 
3 GO: We used the three Gene Ontology thesauri of GO function    , GO component    , and GO process.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.F. Interaction and Identity 
One participant described Pinterest as a " community of people who don't know each other " Kendra.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.Introduction

Methods
Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.Both personal and professional users viewed Pinterest as a platform where they could reach an audience.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in 
TPC-W
In the next set of experiments    , we used a TPC-W implementation written in Java.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.Images added on Pinterest are termed pins; we will use the terms pin and image interchangeably.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.A pin can be created by pinning or importing from a URL external to pinterest .com    , or repinning from a existing pin on pinterest."1'o automatically produce the thesaurus from LDOCE    , two programs have been dcveloped:

The newspaper data set made available to us ranges from 1618 to 1995 4 and consists of more than 102 million OCRed newspaper items.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.Harvested metadata that has no corresponding digital resource is not indexed in OAIster.In

Enviromnent for performance eval- uation
 In this paper    , we evaluate the performance for the Zipflike distribution as is used in the AS3AP benchmarks 
iz X fi = 1 conslad' 1 5 i 5 n 
In this formula    , z is the decay factor and constant' is the n-th harmonic number of order z.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Multiple Formats 
Similarly    , a digital document may exist in different media types    , such as plain text    , HTML    , I&TEX    , DVI    , postscript    , scanned-image    , OCRed text    , or certain PC-a.pplication format.Local    , as well as rating and review services such as TripAdvisor.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.TripAdvisor 2 for vacation trip planning    , and we assume that one such tool has been employed.User query strings were extracted by automated means from a sample of OAIster transaction logs recorded a few days each month over several months in 2003 and 2004.These queries are listed in 
The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.Thus    , creating consistent enriched subject metadata is one of the biggest challenges of the OAIster collection.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.– The gene ExpressionPattern being revealed in the image    , as defined by the Drosophila anatomy ontology 5 .However    , social users of Pinterest contribute the majority of activity     , and have a higher probability of returning to the site.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.ok200706301185791252056 "     , what you get is a profile which is built runtime by querying all the data sources on the web which are indexed by Sindice 5 .These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.For TPC-W queries    , this log merging delay was about 25% of the total latency.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.In TPC-W    , one server alone can sustain up to 50 EBs.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.Pinterest
Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to store and categorise images.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality    , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user‐spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the  Rest of the spots sorting First of all    , we sort the probability of user interest of dislike for each category in ascending way.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.Pinterest Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to save images and categorize them on different collections .Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.electric current."When the description field is used    , only terms found in FOLDOC are included in the query.We first describe the process of curating identities on Pinterest.Pinterest adoption most commonly occurred one year to six months prior to our interviews.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.We use rule-based approach for title detection using page and line features calculated from OCRed text    , bounding box information    , and context analysis.For all runs    , FOLDOC was used in the query analysis process for query expansion.  , which are globally recognised on Pinterest.The feature extraction step uses OCRed text and the bounding box information to calculate line features for every text line contained within a scanned volume.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Activity
As stated before    , Pinterest is all about pins    , thus our first analysis focuses on the activity of the users.Craigslist.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.FOLDOC was used for query expansion.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.The ten largest repositories by size in MB from our 9/2/2006 OAIster harvest are listed in 
98626
The metadata OAIster collects is in Simple Dublin Core format.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.The first term is as in 
New York Times Articles N > 2 
We perform our approach on New York Times articles.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .Additionally    , we explored content from cultural organizations represented on Pinterest.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.Procedure
For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.WWW 2010  Full Paper April 26-30  Raleigh  NC  USA 
 We first collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor 8 for four travel intentions including 
b    , we can see that different categories of locations are roughly differentiated by our similarity metric    , while under the baseline metric some of them are coupled together.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.Hotel Data
Data Description: We collected 4792 reviews about a well-known hotel brand from TripAdvisor.In 
Binding
Now    , given a query word wi    , we need to find the erroneous variants from the OCRed corpus.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.Lexvo 
Results and Discussion
 This paper presented preliminaries for the development of a generic OWL/DLbased formalism for the representation of linguistic corpora.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.In the case of Pinterest    , we do not have a well accepted global popularity ranking of images .In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".1 We obtained 1  ,212  ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86  ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25  ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 .This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.To analyze the curation activity on Pinterest    , we collected nearly all activities by crawling the main site between 3 and 21 Jan    , 2013.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.Figure 2: Images from Pinterest collections by a Police department and an image uploaded to a wedding pinboard.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.D.

User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.TPC-W Query Execution

Subscription to Services and Aggregation 
This section dives into the social aggregation properties of FriendFeed.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.Three of the most accessible were the Merriam-Webster Pock& Dictionary MPD    , its larger sibling    , the Merriam-Webster Seventh Colegiate ~7 and the Longman Di@ionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.The action of pinning an item to a pinboard is the basic building block of Pinterest.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.We use what is effectively the current standard workload generator for e-commerce sites    , TPC-W 
Client Workload Generator
 The Rice TPC-W implementation includes a workload generator     , which is a standard closed-loop session-oriented client emulator .Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.Likewise    , a third score is computed based on the categories of TripAdvisor UT .  , Pinterest by ind resp.Users can create connections to other users on Pinterest in two ways.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained 
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns 
 4 Comparison between Result of Extraction and BOX Code 
The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.Second    , Pinterest users can pin an organization's content to their personal pinboards.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
We implemented our TSA approach using the New York Times archive 1863-2004.We collected the following four datasets of untrustworthy identities on Pinterest: 
 Suspended identities: The easiest way to obtain data about untrustworthy identities is to identify the identities suspended by Pinterest for violation of ToS.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.In Pinterest    , we also find that users who prefer structured curation i.e.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.From the TripAdvisor data    , we randomly sampled 650 threads.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.For this reason    , we view Pinterest not as a repository of images; rather    , as an infrastructure for repository building.This enriched metadata could then be distributed to meet the needs of access services    , preservation repositories    , and external aggregation services such as OAIster.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times 
Related research is briefly discussed in Section 2.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.We further augment the dictionary with terms of interest that are not present in FOLDOC    , in particular    , topics addressed by W3C standards.For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.WWW 
Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.We find evidence the Pinterest social network is useful for bonding and interaction.New York 
Times.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.For example     , The New York Times and Chicago Tribune provide different viewpoints in their coverage of stories on health care and national defense.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.The second is repinning     , or copying an existing pin on Pinterest.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.The tool that transforms OAIster metadata from Simple Dublin Core to our native DLXS Bibliographic Class was modified so that it could ingest the file from the first step    , and output a transformed metadata record.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.We preprocessed the OAIster collection to produce the bag-of-words representation as follows: Starting with the 668 repositories in the 9/2/2006 harvest    , we excluded 163 primarily non-English repositories    , and 117 small repositories containing fewer than 500 records    , leaving 388 repositories.The category for a Pinterest session is simply the most frequent category among the pins in that session.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

In the experiments described in this paper we used New York Times articles since 1870 for history.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.The test for basic functionality at Craigslist uses the browser to browse advertisements in the San Francisco bay area sfbay.craigslist.org.The TPC-W workload consists of 11 web-interactions    , each consisting of several prepared statements    , which are issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W browsing mix.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.Thus    , line features are designed to estimate properties of OCRed text within a line    , which can be calculated based on OCRed text and bounding box information in the DjVu XML file.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.In terms of the mapping between page index    , the index of a scanned page in the viewable PDF file    , and page number    , the number printed on the original volume    , the program recognizes available page numbers on scanned pages by analyzing the OCRed text in particular areas of pages.Later    , in §5.3    , we will show how we can actually leverage these signals together to curate identities on Pinterest.pins for majority to appear 
PRELIMINARIES
We begin by briefly describing Pinterest    , our terminology    , and the dataset used in the rest of this paper: Pinterest is a photo sharing website that allows users to organise thematic collections of images.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.The other dataset contains 200 reviews randomly selected from Tripadvisor.The Real Social Benefits of Pinterest
 Given the finding that social links are not critical for identifying pins    , the most critical activity on Pinterest    , it is puzzling that its social network is counted amongst the fastest growing across all platforms 2 .TPC-W contains a total of 14 different web interactions.We choose the DjVu XML 
 The DjVu XML file retains the bounding box information of every single OCRed word    , from which we can estimate format features.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.BIB 
Questions were put to us concerning the accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes.
