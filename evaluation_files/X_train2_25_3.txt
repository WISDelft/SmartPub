We used a version of the LocusLink database containing 128  ,580 entries.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.The third dataset is the second largest in Wikia    , Muppet    , whose articles are about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.Her own practice in her office with digital material was almost entirely of on-screen reading from her laptop; mostly of digital journals    , but also of online scans of mediaeval material.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.The input to our method is a set of queries; each query is associated with Trels Term RELevance Sets    , which consist of two sets of terms: 1 http://dmoz.org  onTopic: contains terms related to the query that are likely to appear in relevant documents.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 .We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.Automatic knowledge base population by extracting entity information from large-scale unstructured text data has been shown to be a very challenging task in the recent TAC KBP program 1 .The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents    , learned contemporary works    , articles from journals    , etc.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.The collocations were extracted from the TAC KBP collection

The Metric Context
The primary objective of the MESUR project is to study the relationship between usage-based value metrics e.g.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.TDT has been more and more important.Zhu    , Kraut    , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.For the user study    , we have randomly chosen 10 query entities from PubChem    , each of them representing one feedback cycle inside the system.Detection Evaluation Methodology 
The standard evaluation measures in TDT are miss and false alarm rates.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.They are required to recommend 10 items for each user on Douban dataset.aggregation ingestion

We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.length on FBIS.Upweighting of positive examples: yes w = 5.  dimacsAw20w5: Representation: Windows with halfwindow size 20    , selected using LocusLink information.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.TDT corpora

Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.These queries are listed in 
The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i    , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified    , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.We choose this language pair because its ground-truth Entity Linking annotations are available through the TAC-KBP program .A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.To our surprise    , although gIndex is the oldest method among all representative graph indexing techniques we consider    , it performs the best for sparse datasets AIDS and PubChem since its pruning power is the best    , and thus    , the I/O cost is usually the lowest.The resuiting TDT corpus includes 15  ,863 news stories spanning July 1    , 1994    , through June 30    , 1995.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.The TDT benchmark evaluations since 1997 have used the settings of 
1 1 = w     , 1 .  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC

Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.Nevertheless    , the experts in the chemical domain have provided a dictionary-based binary fingerprint for chemical structures in Pubchem dataset for similarity search.Semantic Search Engine 
The dictionary for finding gene mentions was automatically derived from the full LocusLink database    , and included 156  ,533 genes with a total of 387  ,850 synonyms.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network

We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.A novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies 
THE MESUR ONTOLOGY
The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in 
DISCUSSION
 In order to gain more intuition on which cases TSA approach should be applied    , we provide real examples of the strengths and weaknesses of our methods compared to the state of the art ESA method.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere.

Experimental results on FBIS corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and our lexicalized reordering model.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.We used a set of 9  ,403 recent MEDLINE documents associated with LocusLink GeneRIF records.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.FriendFeed allows aggregation of information from a number of services that include popular social networking     , video sharing    , photo sharing    , and blogging services.bos taurus    , danio rerio and c. elegans -obtained through Locuslink.LocusLink entries    , and consisted of 50 queries each.Our training data is the FBIS corpus containing about 7.1 million Chinese words and 9.2 million English words.term InChI=1S/C5H8O/c1-2-4-6-5- 3-1/h2  ,4H  ,1  ,3  ,5H2 
cannot be found because the responsible entity in the original document could not be matched uniquely to the PubChem entities.Evaluation
 Our final run on the evaluation portion of TDT-2 produced 146 clusters.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.This approach is taken in the PubChem Compound Database http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for users to search similar graphs for a given query graph.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013 
 F 1  over this submission    , evaluated using a comparable approach.Defining and validating usage-based metrics: MESUR defines a wide range of usage-based metrics    , calculates them for the established reference data set    , and assesses their validity and reliability.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.From those terms    , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.Consider all the suggested queries QTDT     , TP  that are    , both in the list that is dwelled for no shorter than TDT     , and    , ranked at positions no lower than TP dwell time ≥ TDT and position ≤ TP .Experimental methodology
Datasets
Douban 7 is one of the largest Chinese social platforms for sharing reviews and recommendations for books    , movies and music.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.14 
EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
To empirically study the effectiveness of our method    , we perform experiments on a multi-domain dataset crawled from the publicly available site Douban 2 .The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere. "EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.claims    , we chose a particular number of  
Chemical Entity Recognition and Query Expansion with Synonyms from PubChem
A distinct feature of chemical documents in general is the fact that chemical molecules in those documents can be represented in multiple textual ways    , and a simple keyword search would not suffice to have effective results.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.Conclusion
 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .To do our first experiment    , we took a random 1‰ sample of the PubChem database resulting in around 48.000 chemical entities.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.We use MERT

Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.Currently    , the scholarly community has one primary means of understanding the value of a journal and thus its authors: the ISI Impact Factor 
LEVERAGING RELATIONAL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY
 The MESUR project makes use of a triple store to represent and access its collected data.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.We compare Dscaler to state-of-the-art techniques    , using synthetic TPC-H and real financial    , Douban- Book datasets.GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.Even otherwise    , there are approaches see 
CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.For the large dataset    , we use a real chemical compound dataset referred to here as PubChem.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.Therefore     , the MESUR owl:ObjectProperty taxonomy provides two types of object properties: ContextProperty and InferredProperty see

The Context class has two subclasses: Event and State.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.In our experiment    , for Douban dataset U consists of 2000 testing users    , and an ideal recommender model can recommend 20000 |I| = 20000 unique items at most if each testing user is suggested a list of 10 items.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.Therefore    , uncertainty quantification is important to MESUR as it will help to assess the reliability of results obtained from mining the reference data set.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.WikiWars.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.precision = P C
Implementation
 The collection used in the experiments is part of TDT- 3 1 .An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.Previous TDT research 
Description of Experiment
Our new approach to document representation is based on the idea of conceptual indexing using lexical chaining.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.Present scale and span
 So far    , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties    , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events    , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts.PubChem has 23.98 vertices and 25.76 edges    , on average .RESULTS ON DOUBAN.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.The similarity of two graphs is defined as the Tanimoto score of their fingerprints in PubChem.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .Douban is a well-known website for users to express their preference on movies    , books and music    , where we crawled users' feedbacks on movies.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.These MESUR classes are mesur:Agent    , mesur:Document    , and mesur:Context 7 .This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.Results on NASDAQ Dataset
 Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.For the purposes of the MESUR project    , a network-based approach to data analysis will play a major role in quantifying the value of the scholarly artifacts contained within it.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.Reference data set representation
 The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes    , cites    , uses and different types of content bibliographic data    , citation data    , usage data    , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 
Research data set
 The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events    , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.To address this problem we used the PubChem SQL dump to store all entity data in a file based hash map.The MESUR project was started in October of 2006 and thus    , is still in its early stages of development.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.As a result    , all usage data in the MESUR reference data set is anonymized both regarding individual and institutional identity.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.This article introduces preliminary results from the MESUR project    , all of which strongly confirm the potential of scholarly usage data as a tool to study the dynamics of scholarship in real time    , and to form the basis for the definition of novel metrics of scholarly impact.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states 
.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues
 The test set had a substantially higher proportion of relevant pairs than the training set 
AD HOC RETRIEVAL TASK
The ad hoc retrieval task assessed text retrieval systems on information needs of real biomedical researchers.The data provided by AcroMed 4     , LocusLink 5     , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.
