To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.We could not scale up the LSI module in time to handle the Genomics data    , so we only used the gene synonyms created from the Gene Ontology harvest and nouns and phrases identified by the NLP module to expand the queries.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.  , JCPenney    , Best Buy    , and Walmart.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.See

.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.It is likely that monitoring all items for sale at Walmart    , say    , is not of interest.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.The Gerbil platform already integrates the methods of Agdis- tis

We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.In particular     , when the system tries to estimate the similarity between the input text and the cellular component axe of the Gene Ontology    , the argumentative classification    , which tends to select CONCLUSION and PURPOSE passages should be refined to take advantage of METHODS segments    , since cellular components and tissues are often given in METHODS and MATERIALS sections of articles 
 Introduction
Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.This strategy was used as a follow on from our success in the BioNLP task at Coling 2004
Categorization Task
Task Description
 The Mouse Genomics MGI team currently manually curate new articles for annotation with Gene Ontology GO codes.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .In the following    , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.Introduction

In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.More recently    , there has been great interest in the application of ontological technologies    , particularly since the advent of the Gene Ontology

User Roles and Ontology Life Cycle
One of the key features of knowledge engineering in bioinformatics is the need for community involvement in the development of schemas and ontologies.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.REFERENCES
 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.The categorization task was composed of a document triage subtask and an annotation subtask to detect the presence of evidence in the document for each of the three main Gene Ontology GO code hierarchies.University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.instance    , the Gene Ontology 1     , which is widely used in life science    , contains 472  ,041 triples.Use Case
Examples for collaborative ontology engineering are the development processes of the AGROVOC thesaurus 3 or the Gene Ontology 4 .With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.Gene Ontology 1 or Airport Codes Ontology 2  which are used for benchmarking can be found in

 the ontology.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.  , Walmart.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.The results of this experiment are shown in

Evaluation metrics.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.the Gene Ontology many other ontologies are connected to.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.  , the Agrovoc thesaurus or the Gene ontology.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.These corpus-based relations are formed by a co-occurrence-based algorithm tested earlier in an information retrieval context 
Ontologies
Three ontologies    , the Gene Ontology GO    , the Human Genome HUGO Nomenclature    , and the Unified Medical Language System UMLS    , are used to better integrate the relations.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.BBJoin Cost costBBJoin / BOJoin Cost cost
Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.Many modem manufacturers and retailers - Walmart is a particularly well known example have found extending the companies boundaries in just this way are central to the 'whole concept of Just in Time and process reengineering.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.
