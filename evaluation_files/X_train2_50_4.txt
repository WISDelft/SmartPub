In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.Section 2 describes the size    , origin    , and representation of the MESUR reference data set.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.Since MESUR follows an approach of usage data analysis inspired by clickstream concepts 
It should be noted that both the filtering and de-duplication sub-tasks are inherently statistical procedures    , and that the achieved success rates influence the quality of the reference data set.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .The relationships between atomic formulae discovered from the UMLS are converted to their propositional equivalents.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.Medical domain knowledge is developed by several different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System UMLS.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.Present scale and span
 So far    , MESUR reached agreements for the exchange of usage data with 14 parties    , and as a result has compiled a data set covering over 1 billion article-level usage events    , as well as all associated bibliographic and citation data.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.In second run    , we used only single terms exist in UMLS.claims    , we chose a particular number of  
Chemical Entity Recognition and Query Expansion with Synonyms from PubChem
A distinct feature of chemical documents in general is the fact that chemical molecules in those documents can be represented in multiple textual ways    , and a simple keyword search would not suffice to have effective results.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Prior literature in biomedical WSD uses older versions of UMLS data    , e.g.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features 
simtq    , t d  := maxcossgtq    , sgdq    , 0     , 
where sgt is the word embedding vector of term t learned by the SkipGram algorithm 
bm d tq = arg max t d ∈d simtq    , t d  bmqt d  = arg max tq ∈q simtq    , t d  δst    , d = simt    , bm d t 
δsq    , t = simbmqt    , t     , 4 Term repetition is avoided since the number of occurrences of the term t in d is already counted in fL i .The most comprehensive open access database for the area of chemistry is PubChem 14 .Generating maps of science: MESUR produces maps of science on the basis of its reference data set.WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.Hotel Reviews We use a subset of hotel reviews crawled from TripAdvisor.However    , surprisingly    , we found that using a single expansion term achieves the best performance on the RepLab 2014 test collection.We identified synonyms using a combination of tools from the UMLS.Although the absolute performance of the best learned function seems low 0.63 accuracy    , we will see in the following sections that    , once the classification confidence is used as similarity measure    , it leads to the best topic detection performance reported on the RepLab dataset so far.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.For the UMLS CUI indexes    , however    , some additional processing was required.TripAdvisor 2 for vacation trip planning    , and we assume that one such tool has been employed.1 We obtained 1  ,212  ,153 threads from TripAdvisor forum 6 ; 2 We obtained 86  ,772 threads from LonelyPlanet forum 7 ; 3 We obtained 25  ,298 threads from BootsnAll Network 8 .EXPERIMENTS
Data Sets and Distance Functions
 We employ three image data sets: CoPhIR    , SIFT    , ImageNet     , and several data sets created from textual data.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.Road network N1 is obtained from OpenStreetMap and contain all roads    , while road network N2 is obtained from the Beijing traffic management bureau and contains only highways and main roads.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.The conceptual indexing of queries and documents is based on using UMLS concepts.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.Word similarity judgment For similarity judgment correlations    , we selected two existing benchmarks that have the largest vocabulary overlap with our data: MEN 3K 
Single-word image retrieval 
 In order to visualize the acquired meaning for individual words    , we use images from the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet 
Sentence structure
In the following experiments    , we examine the knowledge of sentence structure learned by IMAG- INET    , and its impact on the model performance on image and paraphrase retrieval.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.We selected all French/English single words from the UMLS 6 meta-thesaurus.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.This approach is taken in the PubChem Compound Database http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for users to search similar graphs for a given query graph.Additional Information from UMLS 
Besides supplying CUIs for identifying synonyms of terms    , the UMLS Metathesaurus provides other information that can be used when preparing sets of query terms.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."The semantic types in UMLS are based on categories such as organisms and chemicals.However    , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen    , available as Shapefiles 10 .  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.Such behavior of hiding consumer reviews has been reported several times in

Matching Reviews
Inspired by tonyk81's matching review text described above    , we create a feature that captures the proportion of sentences any pair of reviews from the same reviewer share to the total number of reviews that reviewer made.If a phrase that contained a number of UMLS strings was to appear in the report text    , such as " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation    , " it would be tagged in this case as containing five different UMLS concepts: " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. "In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.To our surprise    , although gIndex is the oldest method among all representative graph indexing techniques we consider    , it performs the best for sparse datasets AIDS and PubChem since its pruning power is the best    , and thus    , the I/O cost is usually the lowest.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.also the first query of the 'user' block in 
Publishing OpenStreetMap Geo Data
In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed    , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.Furthermore    , the MESUR project aims to contribute to the study of large-scale semantic networks.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.on the Xanga dataset.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.As future work    , we intend to evaluate the impact of the service in the expansion of BDBComp as well as on its sustainability.In this section    , we describe how we create a gold standard by performing human annotation on a data set of hotel reviews from TripAdvisor.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.3 Using an extract of the TripAdvisor website 5 250k ratings    , we used our method for studying hotel ratings.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.a free-text inverted index and several UMLS CUI indexes.This was achieved using publicly available database of medical terms called UMLS Metathesaurus.OpenStreetMap.The resulting top concepts were converted to terms as in query expansion with UMLS Metathesaurus.Given a pair of UMLS concepts    , YTEX can produce knowledge based and distributional based similarity measures.For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.The feature semantic_jaccard is similarly defined by the Best RepLab system 
Metadata Features.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.Nevertheless    , the experts in the chemical domain have provided a dictionary-based binary fingerprint for chemical structures in Pubchem dataset for similarity search.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.3 How would you grade your knowledge of bibliographic self-archiving after using the BDBComp service  ?Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.Thus    , the MESUR ontology is constrained to bibliographic and usage data since these are the primary sources of scholarly data.However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .To analyze our results further    , we grouped the query terms into three classes: 1 chunk terms obtained from the output of LT CHUNKER    , 2 UMLS terms recognized by MetaMap and    , 3 synonyms of the UMLS terms.Estimation Accuracy: We compare our CLA size estimators with a systematic excerpt 
End-to-End Experiments
 To study end-to-end CLA benefits    , we ran several algorithms over subsets of Mnist480m and ImageNet.To do our first experiment    , we took a random 1‰ sample of the PubChem database resulting in around 48.000 chemical entities.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.UMLS provides a hierarchy between concepts through several relations including narrower than    , synonymous to    , and others.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS
For meta search aggregation problem we use the LETOR 
WWW 
NDCGπ    , L@K = 1 GK L K X i=1 2 Lπ −1 i − 1 logi + 1 12 where Lπ −1 i
 is the relevance level of the document with rank i in π    , and GK L is a normalizing constant that ensures that a perfect ordering has an NDCG value of 1.For example    , it is not meaningful to send the query " diabetes " to TripAdvisor .com    , a travel resource.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.The purpose of the MESUR project is to study usage behavior in the scholarly process and therefore    , usage modeling is a necessary component of the MESUR ontology.The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.In BDBComp see 
Effectiveness Without Any Training
To analyze the effectiveness of our method without using any training example    , we execute NC with default eters i.e.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .The first term is as in 
New York Times Articles N > 2 
We perform our approach on New York Times articles.UMLS

Products Dataset Experiments
In this section    , we evaluate the efficacy of our approaches on a real electronic products dataset collected from two different data sources: Best Buy and Walmart.The UMLS Semantic Network was also included in the Semantic Web.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .We will refer to this version as UMLS-CUI-sen. Once the four versions of the concept documents are obtained     , we build the four corresponding UMLS-CUI indexes using Indri.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Another example is the LinkedGeoData project 4 which provides Linked Data about any circular and rectangular area on Earth 
AllDataW  = datad | d ∈ D .First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.Dataset Description
Stack Overflow provides a periodic database dump of all user-generated content under the Creative Commons Attribute- ShareAlike 
Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.Maybe the synonyms in UMLS are not very relevant to this particular task.A clinical semantic knowledge is established from these terms extracted by matching UMLS.LETOR Results
 In §7.1.1    , we compare BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem ; in §7.1.2    , we compare BARACO and the EM-based approach 
Switching Problem Results
To address RQ1    , we compare the ROC curves of BARACO and MT on the Switching Problem.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.In the following    , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.USER STUDY DETAILS
 We collected 250 attractions in Paris from the TripAdvisor website .The second data set further referred to as Hotel consists of reviews of hotels crawled from TripAdvisor 5 along with the meta-data of review authors     , such as location    , gender and age 6 .University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.For example    , in the New York Times front page shown in

Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.For instance    , users prefer to go to a furniture store to buy furniture rather than to a general purpose store such as Walmart.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.In the replaying stage    , the data in WPBench Store are fed to browsers by a proxy according to the local configuration so that browsers could obtain the Web content as if they were actually from the Internet.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.,b1n .Weights of report concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.  , the best RepLab 2013 systems.Each UMLS atom may have multiple semantic types and possibly multiple semantic groups.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.2. candidates: A possibly empty list of UMLS candidate concepts identified in the phrase.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.We use both methods in our TAC-KBP evaluation.f Xanga web-link categories

In this formula    , z is the decay factor and constant' is the n-th harmonic number of order z.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Relevance-Oriented Recommendation
To evaluate the relevance-oriented recommendation    , we collected the top destinations recommended by TripAdvisor for five travel intentions    , i.e.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.All presented NDCG    , Precision and MAP results are averaged across the test queries and were obtained using the evaluation script available on the LETOR website.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.In addition    , we created a dataset to study OSPC based on the TAC KBP Entity Linking 2009 task dataset    , which is publicly available 8 .We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.The MESUR project attempts to fundamentally increase our understanding of usage data.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.The corresponding UMLS concepts were added as a case feature.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.length on FBIS.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj

The UMLS metathesaurus contains a couple of large tables that relate concepts to one another.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified    , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list.market    , we used data provided by TripAdvisor: The consumers that write reviews about hotels on TripAdvisor also identify their travel purpose business    , romance    , family    , friend    , other  and age group 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In the previous section    , we have discussed how we retrieved different hotel characteristics through various sources.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 I.A UMLS term was considered to be negated 
After lemmatizing the UMLS strings using the GATE stemmer    , we used a trie containing all the UMLS strings with their associated concept IDs to identify exact matches of these strings in the lemmatized corpus and to store the concept IDs for indexing.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.Future work will present benchmark results of the MESUR triple store.20mg while the remaining half were medical terms that are not in UMLS.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.But no explicit social relationships are maintained in TripAdvisor     , so we need to construct an implicit influence network and learn the influence probabilities on the network.We compare our approach to the University of Washington submission to TAC-KBP 2013

Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.From those terms    , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.In order to obtain the graph structure of UMLS    , we simply treat the concepts in UMLS as vertices    , and the relations listed in the MRREL and MRCOC tables as edges.MetaMap was applied for the identification of UMLS concepts in visits.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community."1'o automatically produce the thesaurus from LDOCE    , two programs have been dcveloped:

'2.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.This result strongly suggests that usage-based impact rankings may further converge as MESUR ingests its entire collection of 1 billion usage events    , but that this convergence may very well be towards a notion of scholarly prestige different than the one expressed by the IF.Next    , the chart parser is used to analyse the LDOCE definition of an 'ammeter'    , which is that it "is an instrument for measuring .BIB 
Questions were put to us concerning the accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes.  , the UMLS dataset we use in the experiment have less than 1% positive triples.This paper has described preliminary results derived from an analysis of a subset of the MESUR reference data set that consists of over 200 million article-level usage events.For example     , The New York Times and Chicago Tribune provide different viewpoints in their coverage of stories on health care and national defense.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario    , e.g.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data    , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.We also identified synonyms using UMLS and added them to the query.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.A novel contribution of the presented ontology is its solution to the problem of scalability found in modern triple store technologies 
THE MESUR ONTOLOGY
The MESUR ontology is currently at version 2007-01 at http://www.mesur.org/schemas/2007-01/mesur abbreviated mesur.Local    , as well as rating and review services such as TripAdvisor.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.Note that as ImageNet is still a resource under development    , not all word pairs in the datasets presented in section 4 are covered.  , Walmart.BDBComp has been designed to be OAI compliant and adopts Dublin Core DC as its metadata standard.Queries for UMLS-CUI indexes
We created three versions of queries for UMLS-CUI indexes as follows: 1.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset

 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .From the TripAdvisor data    , we randomly sampled 650 threads.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.To help assess generality    , we have begun to study OpenStreetMap    , a significantly different community.Using Neo4j    , a graph building API for Java    , we constructed a graph of UMLS    , where the nodes were concepts and the edges were relationships from the UMLS related terms table.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.Suppose that a user interested in comparative shopping wishes to find popular cellphones that have been manufactured in the " USA " and are listed on two distinct data sources: Best Buy and Walmart with at least 300 reviews at each source.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.3 We evaluate our model and features on the ImageNet hierarchies with two different taxonomy induction tasks Section 5.In our experiments with retail store data from Walmart    , we generated ranges by sliding    , over the time period    , a window of size 5 days with a step of 3 days.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.The second synonym was obtained from UMLS.As an example of a simple system    , we could cite BDBComp Biblioteca Digital Brasileira de Computação 
In existing systems    , in general    , such configurations are performed manually or via command-line scripts.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.Therefore     , the MESUR owl:ObjectProperty taxonomy provides two types of object properties: ContextProperty and InferredProperty see

Figure 10: Classes of Context and their properties 
The Context class has two subclasses: Event and State.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.Section 5 describes how the UMLS can be applied to semantic matching.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.For this we have detailed the steps involved and how the UMLS can be used.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.We have used the 2008AA version of the UMLS in all of our experiments.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.UMLS Network Query Expansion
This technique represents perhaps our most unique approach to this problem.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.Collaborative spatial data collection efforts     , such as OpenStreetMap 
OVERVIEW
Query Cases
There are five major categories of queries: i feature aggregation queries non-spatial queries    , for example    , queries for finding mean values of attributes or distribution of attributes; ii fundamental spatial queries    , including point based queries    , containment queries and spatial joins; iii complex spatial queries    , including spatial crossmatching or overlay large scale spatial join and nearest neighbor queries; iv integrated spatial and feature queries    , for example    , feature aggregation queries in a selected spatial regions; and v global spatial pattern queries    , for example    , queries on finding high density regions    , or queries to find directional patterns of spatial objects .COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.Passive baseline
In order to establish our passive baseline as state of the art for EF    , we compare it with the best performing system at RepLab.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .To describe those segments    , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.The MESUR ontology provides three subclasses of owl:Thing.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.For the large dataset    , we use a real chemical compound dataset referred to here as PubChem.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .Second    , we will use the rank of spots on TripAdvisor and the rate of the reviews as the indicators of spots' quality     , it embodies the commonness of recommendation system    , while we use the probability of user interest for each category and the classification label of each user-spots pairs as the reflecting of the user personalized interest    , it embodies the personality of recommendation system.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.Textbased searches benefit from relevant descriptive keywords drawn from available ontologies within the UMLS Metathesaurus 4 .At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.Synonyms of these genes were retrieved from UMLS.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB 
Comparisons.TripAdvisor 
– .This pipeline is based on Lavrenko's relevance models 
Query and Document Expansion with UMLS
 We also experimented with several approaches to query and document expansion using UMLS.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.We filter the Concepts based on information we have available from the UMLS.Weights of query concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.For example    , travel sites such as TripAdvisor and TravellersPoint offer services that enable users to find hotels with particular facilities and located in particular regions.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.For example    , when taking a random sample of all product items in the Walmart catalog    , more than 40% of the items in the sample are from the segment " Home & Garden " .Consider a news website such as New York Times.OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.PubChem has 23.98 vertices and 25.76 edges    , on average .EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia

Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.UMLS concept extracted at the sentence level    , using bi-­‐directional greedy dictionary matching for noun phrases.For example    , given a new query    , " walmart credit card "     , assume the set of unigrams    , bigrams and trigrams contained in unit vocabulary includes { " walmart "     , " credit "     , " card "     , " credit card " }    , then we only keep " walmart " and " credit card " in the unit set.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU."

 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in

 Introduction
 The goal of the Text Analysis Conference Knowledge Base Population TAC-KBP Slot Filling SF task 
1 Supervised classification.We also explored several query expansion strategies based on the UMLS metathesaurus.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.These facts in their logical forms denoted as F UMLS  and rules denoted as R UMLS  are used to infer relations between two terms.The preliminary results discussed in the following sections were generated on the basis of an early subset of the MESUR data set that was selected to offer the best possible outcomes at the time:  200 million article-level usage events: A subset consisting of the most thoroughly validated and deduplicated usage events.  , Walmart    , Home Depot    , Subway and McDonald's.bl1  ,bl2  ,.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.The UMLS semantic network describes semantic relations such as causes between two semantic types.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.The UMLS Metathesaurus is used as the knowledge-base    , and we represent UMLS as a graph.Moreover    , NLP tools for utilizing the information from UMLS have been developed.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.We obtained the transcripts of both events from the New York Times 2 .Lexvo 
Results and Discussion
 This paper presented preliminaries for the development of a generic OWL/DLbased formalism for the representation of linguistic corpora.In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.MetaMap only identifies UMLS concepts    , which are then mapped to SNOMED CT concepts.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.UMLS ® terms are recognized and expanded with their synonyms.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .The weights of DNN are learned on ILSVRC-2010 1     , which is a subset of ImageNet 2 dataset with 1.26 million training images from 1  ,000 categories.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.However    , many the expansions provided by UMLS consist of phrasal expressions e.g. "The other dataset contains 200 reviews randomly selected from Tripadvisor.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.electric current."We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.WWW2004    ,

Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.Researching sampling bias: MESUR examines the effects of sampling biases on its reference data set to determine whether and how a usage data set can be compiled that is representative of global scholarly us- age.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?CONCLUSIONS

The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.Our hypothesis is that performance will improve by expanding queries using synonyms from UMLS.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains CUIs that arise from source ontologies     , which maintain hierarchical relationships between concepts.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.To address this problem we used the PubChem SQL dump to store all entity data in a file based hash map.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.For Part B    , we filtered out the CHEM group for the UMLS concept text but not from the UMLS CUIs.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The current research focuses on the writing style participants use in English-language reviews of tourist attractions at TripAdvisor     , a site that prides itself on being international in scope    , operating in 34 countries.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.In §7.1    , we analyse the performance of BARACO and MT on the LETOR data; in §7.2    , we analyse their performance on the WSDM data.We used part of UMLS hierarchy weights P@10 Avg.By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.Session-based grouping: Usage data is typically recorded and hence provided to MESUR as a time-sequential list of individual events recorded by an information system; different events generated by the same agent in the course of a certain time span are not grouped.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.PubChem consists of 1 million graphs and is a subset of the PubChem chemical structure database 4 .While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the

Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.In certain cases    , the usage data is provided by the source in an anonymized form    , in other cases MESUR is responsible for the required processing.Types of relations that SemRep identifies is pre-defined by the UMLS.Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 .LETOR 2 challenge datasets.Features of relevance view were exactly the same as those in traditional documents ranking    , as were reported in LETOR
The features of intrinsic view were query-independent    , and those social attributes of tweets such as @ mentions    , # hashtags    , and retweeted count were incorporated.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.On average    , our strategies converge at about 15 iterations on the LETOR datasets    , and around 5 to 10 iterations on the multi-relevance judgment datasets.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained 
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns 
 4 Comparison between Result of Extraction and BOX Code 
The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.The first one    , RepLab Baseline    , is composed of 31 different SVM classifiers    , each trained on tweets relating to a single entity 
Reputation Dimensions Classification Results 
 In this section    , we report and analyse the results of our proposed tweet enrichment approach.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.We filter out the photos that are not located in the city by latitude and longitude boundary as shown in 
Evaluation Measure
We extract a set of tourist attractions in the metadata of OpenStreetMap.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.term InChI=1S/C5H8O/c1-2-4-6-5- 3-1/h2  ,4H  ,1  ,3  ,5H2 
cannot be found because the responsible entity in the original document could not be matched uniquely to the PubChem entities.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.  , OpenStreetMap is about 300 GB.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site 
User lifespan.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.The patents refer to 1291 UMLS concepts.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.UMLS is an ontology of mostly medical terms called atoms.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP

In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.Reference data set representation
 The requirement to handle a variety of semantic relationships publishes    , cites    , uses and different types of content bibliographic data    , citation data    , usage data    , led MESUR to define a context-centric OWL ontology that models the scholarly communication process 
Research data set
 The MESUR reference data now consists of 1 billion individual usage events that were recorded at the documentlevel and processed as described above.In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.We believe that a benchmark like WPBench is useful to evaluate the performance of Web browsers for modern Web 2.0 applications.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.OpenStreetMap OSM.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Suppose that the analyst chooses two such data sources: Best Buy denoted by BB and Walmart denoted by WM.
