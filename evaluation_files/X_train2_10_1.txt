Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .UMLS ® terms are recognized and expanded with their synonyms.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.UMLS semantic network and Metathesaurus are extracted.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .We selected all French/English single words from the UMLS 6 meta-thesaurus.Synonyms of these genes were retrieved from UMLS.Prior literature in biomedical WSD uses older versions of UMLS data    , e.g.A UMLS term was considered to be negated 
After lemmatizing the UMLS strings using the GATE stemmer    , we used a trie containing all the UMLS strings with their associated concept IDs to identify exact matches of these strings in the lemmatized corpus and to store the concept IDs for indexing.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.The Gerbil platform already integrates the methods of Agdis- tis

For our input dictionary we use the Unified Medical Language System UMLS.Every Concept 
 in the UMLS is related to another concept in the UMLS hierarchy via Broader Than RB    , Narrower Than RN    , Parent PAR    , Child CHD and Sibling SIB relationships    , this information being contained within the MRREL table of the UMLS.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.We also identified synonyms using UMLS and added them to the query.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.However    , many the expansions provided by UMLS consist of phrasal expressions e.g. "All classes of UMLS concepts recognized by MetaMap were used.Note that composite concept terms only appear in the UMLS ontology i.e.We also explored several query expansion strategies based on the UMLS metathesaurus.2. candidates: A possibly empty list of UMLS candidate concepts identified in the phrase.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.Second    , we mapped the concepts to their SNOMED-CT equivalents using the UMLS Meta-thesaurus.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.Medical domain knowledge is developed by several different ontologies including Unified Medical Language System UMLS.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.The second synonym was obtained from UMLS.SNOMED or UMLS seem to be better options.For this we have detailed the steps involved and how the UMLS can be used.In the following    , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL.In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.Using Neo4j    , a graph building API for Java    , we constructed a graph of UMLS    , where the nodes were concepts and the edges were relationships from the UMLS related terms table.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.In second run    , we used only single terms exist in UMLS.The UMLS semantic network describes semantic relations such as causes between two semantic types.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.The goal is to evaluate the retrieval effectiveness of the UMLS Metathesaurus based query translation strategies .UMLS Term Labeling
Building on the work of Nadkarni    , we also identified terms from the Universal Medical Language System UMLS that appeared in the reports.Weights of query concepts are extended to UMLS 'isa' relationships ontological neighbors.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.This is the context of the node with its UMLS concepts attached to each atomic formula.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The WikiWars corpus 
WikiBios.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.First    , we use the FBIS dataset which contains 300K high quality sentence pairs    , mostly in the broadcast news domain.  , the UMLS dataset we use in the experiment have less than 1% positive triples.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains millions of biomedical and health related concepts.Given a pair of UMLS concepts    , YTEX can produce knowledge based and distributional based similarity measures.Drexel

The ECNUCS results merging run basedef simply returns the output of the official FedWeb resource selection baseline.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.MetaMap was applied for the identification of UMLS concepts in visits.MetaMap only identifies UMLS concepts    , which are then mapped to SNOMED CT concepts.Textbased searches benefit from relevant descriptive keywords drawn from available ontologies within the UMLS Metathesaurus 4 .Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.UMLS Synonym Finder
SCDA used UMLS to augment our symptoms field with their synonyms in both the query frame and our document frames.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.For Part B    , we filtered out the CHEM group for the UMLS concept text but not from the UMLS CUIs.a free-text inverted index and several UMLS CUI indexes.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.One is the Unified Medical Language System UMLS 
UMLS contains a very large dictionary of biomedical terms – the UMLS Metathesaurus and defines a hierarchy of semantic types – the UMLS Semantic Network.The backoff strategy and the interpolation strategy are compared for all three methods using the FBIS database and topics 401-450 i.e.University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.Section 5 describes how the UMLS can be applied to semantic matching.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.Each UMLS atom may have multiple semantic types and possibly multiple semantic groups.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.Maybe the synonyms in UMLS are not very relevant to this particular task.However    , a model trained on data from both Fedweb'12 and Fedweb'13 performed worse    , achieving even a lower performance than their baseline approach NTNUiSrs1 that only uses a document-centric model.For the UMLS CUI indexes    , however    , some additional processing was required.This was achieved using publicly available database of medical terms called UMLS Metathesaurus.Discussion
Orientation can be determined based on word    , phrase and hierarchical phrase

Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.are not annotated with concepts from the UMLS    , however they are kept for logical formula conversion.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.UMLS provides a hierarchy between concepts through several relations including narrower than    , synonymous to    , and others.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.The results are in 
Chinese-English Results
The Chinese-English system was trained on FBIS corpora of 384K sentence pairs    , the English corpus is lower case.Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.Patient summaries were mapped to UMLS codes using MetaMap.Note that in all the results reported    , mentions that contain NIL or empty ground truth entities are discarded before the evaluation; this decision is taken as well in Gerbil version 1.1.4.The semantic types in UMLS are based on categories such as organisms and chemicals.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.The corresponding UMLS concepts were added as a case feature.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.The UMLS Metathesaurus is used as the knowledge-base    , and we represent UMLS as a graph.Queries for UMLS-CUI indexes
We created three versions of queries for UMLS-CUI indexes as follows: 1.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.UMLS concept extracted at the sentence level    , using bi-­‐directional greedy dictionary matching for noun phrases.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.This value was chosen based on some preliminary experiments we performed on the FedWeb 2012 test collection 
Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.We will refer to this version as UMLS-CUI-sen. Once the four versions of the concept documents are obtained     , we build the four corresponding UMLS-CUI indexes using Indri.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.We used part of UMLS hierarchy weights P@10 Avg.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.We identified synonyms using a combination of tools from the UMLS.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.We first extracted all of the UMLS terms that appeared in the query.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.length on FBIS.We use the Gerbil testing platform 
Evaluation metrics.Ensemble of Classifiers
The winner of the KDDCUP 2005 competition found that the best result was achieved by combining the exact matching method and SVM.The patents refer to 1291 UMLS concepts.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.For example if we query the UMLS for the term heart we find that heart has a total of 5 concepts from the UMLS.WikiWars.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.If a phrase that contained a number of UMLS strings was to appear in the report text    , such as " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation    , " it would be tagged in this case as containing five different UMLS concepts: " paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. "We filter the Concepts based on information we have available from the UMLS.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Moreover    , NLP tools for utilizing the information from UMLS have been developed.Additional Information from UMLS 
Besides supplying CUIs for identifying synonyms of terms    , the UMLS Metathesaurus provides other information that can be used when preparing sets of query terms.To measure the relevance between UMLS concepts    , we used personalized PageRank PPR on an ontology graph constructed with a subset of the UMLS concepts.The other two measures are defined according to the standard measures to evaluate the performance of classification     , that is    , precision    , recall and F1-measure 
F 1 = 2 × P × R/P + R 11

Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.The UMLS Semantic Network was also included in the Semantic Web.Types of relations that SemRep identifies is pre-defined by the UMLS.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.These facts in their logical forms denoted as F UMLS  and rules denoted as R UMLS  are used to infer relations between two terms.20mg while the remaining half were medical terms that are not in UMLS.The baseline system is not sufficient to her 
UMLS and MetaMap
The UMLS UMLS    , 2012    , or Unified Medical Language System    , is a set of files and software that brings together many health and biomedical vocabularies.To analyze our results further    , we grouped the query terms into three classes: 1 chunk terms obtained from the output of LT CHUNKER    , 2 UMLS terms recognized by MetaMap and    , 3 synonyms of the UMLS terms.UMLS is an ontology of mostly medical terms called atoms.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.Therefore    , we adopt the UMLS Metathesaurus to expand the concepts.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.The UMLS only includes " ImmunoPrecipitation " and " Immune Precipitation " .3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.SemRep identifies relationships between UMLS concepts in text within the sentences.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.This pipeline is based on Lavrenko's relevance models 
Query and Document Expansion with UMLS
 We also experimented with several approaches to query and document expansion using UMLS.The conceptual indexing of queries and documents is based on using UMLS concepts.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.The UMLS Metathesaurus contains CUIs that arise from source ontologies     , which maintain hierarchical relationships between concepts.We have used the 2008AA version of the UMLS in all of our experiments.In order to obtain the graph structure of UMLS    , we simply treat the concepts in UMLS as vertices    , and the relations listed in the MRREL and MRCOC tables as edges.Our hypothesis is that performance will improve by expanding queries using synonyms from UMLS.MatchedAnswer – The frequency of the matched UMLS semantic categories.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.A clinical semantic knowledge is established from these terms extracted by matching UMLS.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.Query Expansion
UMLS Related Terms Query Expansion
The UMLS metathesaurus contains a couple of large tables that relate concepts to one another.FedWeb Resource Selection
The Federated Web Search FedWeb resource selection task RS requires participants to rank candidate search engines    , known as resources    , according to the applicability of their contents to test topics.UMLS Network Query Expansion
This technique represents perhaps our most unique approach to this problem.The relationships between atomic formulae discovered from the UMLS are converted to their propositional equivalents.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.UMLS
