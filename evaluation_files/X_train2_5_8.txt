It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.on the Xanga dataset.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.Thus    , although over a sixth of Xanga users have provided email addresses    , we cannot use it when trying to match users across networks.TJU CS IR
This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.As a case study    , we collect a Chinese hotel review dataset from booking.com.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.Xanga treats email addresses differently: users can provide their email address to Xanga    , and visitors can use the website to send email    , without the address being visible directly.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.Recall that the Wikitravel suggestions all have explicit categories    , whereas for the examples we had to estimate a category.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by

This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.Booking.com Baseline
We use the currently live ranking method at Booking.Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.Xanga.By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.f Xanga web-link categories 
General profile statistics
Fig.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .
