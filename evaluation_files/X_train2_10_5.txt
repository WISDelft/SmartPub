This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.The edge density of this group is 0.476. b c: Horizontal axis is the normalized number of open/closed triads at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and vertical axis is the normalized number of open/closed one month later.In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.First    , our design of membership cascade model can be used for group member recommendation    , and may be potentially integrated into current WeChat platform.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.Mariana has been used for more than one year to train models for automatic speech recognition and image recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and for Ads pCTR in Tencent QQ and Qzone.We found it's hard to construct a one-size-fits-all framework to support a wide range of applications including speech recognition and image recognition in WeChat    , and Ads pCTR in QQ and Qzone.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.While Qi did not use WeChat to seek romantic partners    , others did.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.The results also suggest that WeChat reinforces    , reconfigures    , and enhances many social practices of Chinese users.One option is to extract all lexical information from the URI    , labels    , properties and property values of the LOD resources that are retrieved by Sindice search.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.  , foaf:mbox and foaf:homepage    , then a Sindice index search for other resources having the same IFP value is performed.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.For example    , Mei    , who lives in Qi's experience highlights that different people may have varying intentions in using WeChat.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.Our dataset is about " tourism in Killarney Ireland " and it was created as follows: 
One option was to use Sindice for dynamic querying.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .Opportunistic encounters: forming instrumental ties 
In understanding the interpersonal relationships in China    , Hwang talks about the notion of instrumental ties    , which serve only as a means to attain certain goals    , which    , for example    , happen between salesmen and customers    , or bus drivers and passengers 
Romance seeking and intention clashes 
 WeChat also influences how some people seek romantic relationships .Now Mariana becomes the basis of model training for all ASR functions in WeChat.the Sindice dump for each entity candidate.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.The multi-GPU data parallelism DNN framework is used to build the acoustic model of automatic speech recognition in Tencent WeChat    , and gains a speedup of 4.6 times by 6 GPUs in one server compared to one GPU.However    , what is it about WeChat that makes it unique  ?In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.recommender systems 
JESTER 1.0
The recommendation engine in Jester 1.0 retrieved jokes using nearest neighbor search.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.Automatic Speech Recognition
Automatic speech recognition is now used in Tencent WeChat as voice input    , speech open platform    , and translating audio message to text.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.4 Validation on new data sets    , such as the Jester data set 
 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.At least some WeChat users take advantage of these features to seek romantic partners     , serving as a reconfiguration of traditional practices.This is performed via textual or URI search on the Sindice index and yields a set of of source URLs that are added to the input source URL set.REFERENCES
 INTRODUCTION
Backgroud
Tencent provides a wide range of Internet services    , such as WeChat    , a mobile social platform having 396 millions of monthly active users MAU    , QQ    , an instant messaging platform having 848 millions of MAU    , and Qzone    , a social networking service having 644 millions of MAU in the first quarter of 2014.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Currently    , submission of new SNP entries into SNP repositories such as dbSNP by NCBI 
METHODS
Our proposed theory assumes that any SNP sequence can be given an identity instantaneously.One distinct characteristic of the three novel WeChat social features is that they enable random encounters among strangers without any commonality.Proposed Concept-Based Search on the Web of Data
The proposed concept-based search mechanism is fully implemented 2 and its system architecture is shown in 
Recognizing Context of Linked Open Data Resources
In order to generate concept-based search results    , first the retrieved LOD resources from the Sindice search need to be categorized under UMBEL concepts.The dataset is available in two different formats: structured around documents Sindice-DE and structured around entities Sindice-ED.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.The open source Sindice any23 4 parser is used to extract RDF data from many different formats.Uniqueness of WeChat 
WeChat is one of the many MIMs in the market.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.A chat group on WeChat can be analogy to a community    , where one can chat with several friends all at once.  , making ample use of the Sindice public cache.MIMs have transformed relationship maintenance from offline to online environments and have provided more opportunities for users to keep in touch with their close friends and family members O'
WeChat Opportunistic Social Features 
WeChat provides three novel social features: Shake    , Drift Bottle    , and Look Around 1 that enable opportunistic interactions between random users on the platform.However    , Sindice search results may change due to dynamic indexing.Tencent is a major social network provider in mainland China    , running a platform for its instant messaging QQ service     , many online games    , a social network and social media WeChat service    , online Video service and others.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.a WeChat group membership b Membership invitation 
 User Set U: It consists of all the members belonging to the sampled groups as well as their one-hop neighbors    , as of August 28    , 2015.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.Meanwhile     , a WeChat official account can choose to authorize XiaoIce to respond to its followers' utterances .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.While WeChat supports many other important features including Moments for photo sharing    , Friend Radar for searching nearby friends and Sticker Gallery    , it is important to note that those are beyond the scope of our research focus in this paper.The Sindice index does not only allow search for keywords    , but also for URIs mentioned in documents.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the 
 INRODUCTION
Jester 2.0 is a WWW-based system that allows users to retrieve jokes baaed on their ratings of sample jokes.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.Then    , these queries were used to query WoD with Sindice to gather data about available URIs.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.To bring together a wide rang of participants to support and participate in crowdsourcing task    , we adopt the various popular social networking platforms to spread widely    , including website promotion    , SNS social networking    , microblog    , WeChat and instant communication tools.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .Sindice 
Contributions
 In our approach    , users access to the WoD with keyword or Uniform Resource Identifier URI queries.ok200706301185791252056 "     , what you get is a profile which is built runtime by querying all the data sources on the web which are indexed by Sindice 5 .Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .These two sub-collections are built from the same crawl; however    , blank nodes are filtered out in Sindice-ED    , therefore it is a subset of Sindice-DE.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.The Ionosphere data set analysis the quality of a radar returns from ionosphere.SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i    , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.c: Horizontal axis is the edge density at the setting up of a WeChat group    , and veritcal axis is the edge density one month later.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.With voice input    , users talk to WeChat directly    , get the corresponding text message automatically    , and send to friends.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "Here we report how five informants used the novel social features of WeChat to establish Guanxi ties in unfamiliar environments where the platform both reinforces and enhances traditional practices.We studied a particular MIM    , WeChat.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.For example    , acoustic model of automatic speech recognition for Chinese and English in Tencent WeChat adopts a deep neural network with more than 50 millions of parameters    , more than 15 thousands of senones tied triphone model which is represented by one output node in output layer in a DNN    , and tens of billions of samples    , so it would cost years to train this model by a single CPU server    , or months by a single off-the-shelf GPU.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .The three novel WeChat social features allow a user to get " matched " to another random user.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
