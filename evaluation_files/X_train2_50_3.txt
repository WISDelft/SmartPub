On Reddit    , over half of articles were discarded because they appeared for less than an hour in the range of positions studied.Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset We use the New York Times Corpus 2 from year 1987 to 2007 for training.desire 
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the TDT cost function to evaluate our result-filtering task.Statistical Modelling Framework
Driven by the requirements we propose a modelling and publishing framework for statistics on the Web of Data consisting of: 
– a core vocabulary for representing statistical data – a " workflow " to create the statistical data 
The framework is depicted at a glance in 
Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO
 One of the main contributions of our work at hand is the Statistical Core Vocabulary SCOVO 5 .Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.For example    , in a correctly segmented corpus    , there will be very few " york times " segments most " york times " occurrences will be in the " new york times " segments    , resulting in a small value of PCyork times    , which makes sense.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .Suppose a dwell time threshold TDT and a position threshold TP are set up.Given a flow of text messages    , TDT aims at identifying trending topics in a streamed source.The earlier can be used to capture more information pertaining to the creation of a particular statistical item; – Defining sub-properties of using SCOVO-min and max.Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.As an example    , there are 20 different sources in the data for TDT 2002.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.Finally    , we note that it appears that less active users are less likely to join an aggregation service such as FriendFeed.The Mean Average Precision MAP results for HGT and NIPS are shown in 
SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.Introduction
Temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different SemEval tasks

Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.WebKB This dataset contains webpages from computer science departments at around four different universities 7 .For the US data set    , we used a set of 1358 New York Times articles to form the reference corpus.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.This paper studies the FriendFeed service    , with emphasis on social aggregation properties and user activity patterns.The annotators unified their schemes by consensus into a hierarchical scheme with 6 coarse-grained and 31 fine-grained motivational factors additional details available at networkdynamics.org/pubs/2016/reddit-exodus/.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .EXPERIMENTS
Data Sets and Distance Functions
 We employ three image data sets: CoPhIR    , SIFT    , ImageNet     , and several data sets created from textual data.An exception is the Datahub data set D    , where the distribution of resources in type sets and property sets seems comparable.These values are depicted inside a rectangle in 
Spreading activation
In a first link-based strategy    , we chose the spreading activation SA approach 
RSVD i  = SIMD i     , Q + λ · SIMD j   ,Q j=1 k ∑ Using 
all the incoming and outgoing links    , and for different values of the parameter λ    , in most cases did not result in retrieval improvement within the WT2g corpus 
RSVD 4  = SIMD 4     , Q + λ · SIMD 2     , Q + λ · SIMD 8     , Q = 90 + 0.1 · 60 + 0.1 · 100 = 106 
 The similarity value of non-retrieved documents e.g.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.The TDT tasks and evaluation approaches were developed by a joint effort between DARPA    , the University of Massachusetts    , Carnegie Mellon    , and Dragon Systems.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.In the end    , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.Some recent work by James Allan exemplifies the extension of TDT to the passage level of documents 2001.Word similarity judgment For similarity judgment correlations    , we selected two existing benchmarks that have the largest vocabulary overlap with our data: MEN 3K 
Single-word image retrieval 
 In order to visualize the acquired meaning for individual words    , we use images from the ILSVRC2012 subset of ImageNet 
Sentence structure
In the following experiments    , we examine the knowledge of sentence structure learned by IMAG- INET    , and its impact on the model performance on image and paraphrase retrieval.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.We conclude that considering the meta data available on Stack Overflow along with natural language characteristics can improve existing approaches when applied to Stack Overflow data.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.Many research organizations take this as their baseline system 
Preprocessing
 A preprocessing has been performed for TDT Chinese corpus.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.The performance difference between the two is subtle: UP-bm25 was shown superior in MAP on Disks 4 & 5 but inferior in P@10 on WT2G.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.The BLOG06 collection contains approximately 100k feed documents    , which are a mix of ATOM and RSS XML.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.Many famous universities and companies such as IBM Watson    , BBN    , CMU and CUHK    , have participated in TDT workshop.While discerning ironic comments on reddit is our immediate task    , the proposed approach is generally applicable to a wide-range of subjective     , web-based text classification tasks.Are the best methods for retrieval over the ad hoc data also the best for the WT2g collection  ?On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We also used private messaging PM features on Reddit and Voat to solicit participation from randomly-selected users.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.In this paper    , we construct a dataset from Reddit and present the first large-scale study on the coexistence of highly related communities.LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.To investigate these questions we chose the New York Times as the platform of study as it is an active community with a high volume of commenting activity.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."We define a video to be " discovered " on Reddit if it's score was in the top 10% of scores of posts to r/videos in 2012.In ionosphere and pima datasets    , all the SE results are better than the best MSE result    , being the latter obtained with higher hid values than the best SE results.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.  , surrounding code snippets    , the complete answer     , or the corresponding question is available on Stack Overflow    , it would be possible to display it along with an insight sentence.The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.We first randomly sample 10% of the New York Times Corpus documents roughly two years of data    , denoted the NYT Hold-out Data.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.I should because we're always stumped in the New York Times crosswords by the pop music characters.We map these URLs into one of 40 topics    , where these topics were manually selected from the New York Times website and by looking at the URLs themselves.New York Time Annotated Corpus
The New York Times Annotated corpus is used in the synonym time improvement task.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.We find that positivity of feedback in Reddit    , the difference in upvotes and downvotes may play a substantial role    , as shown by the figure below.BRIGHTKITE.As an example    , a search performed in OAIster for " double-well Duffing oscillator " retrieves two records    , exactly the same    , but one was harvested from the arXiv.org Eprint Archive repository an original repository and one harvested from the CiteBase repository an aggregator.1987 or by Boguraev 1986 and 1987 is to take the sense distinctions provided by LDOCE.Passage: Paul Krugman is also an author and a columnist for The New York Times.Please consult

This section dives into the social aggregation properties of FriendFeed.For example     , while New York Times knows which articles the user read    , it does not know why what features in the article led the user to read them.REFERENCES
 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.More detail about applying relevance models to TDT can be found in 
Evaluation
TDT tasks are evaluated as detection tasks.We are encouraged by our method's ability to recover ground truth from the MusicLab experiment but we recognize that although Reddit and Hacker News are similar in some ways    , they are fundamentally different.We sample 300 potentially frame-evoking word types from the New York Times: 100 each nouns    , verbs    , and adjectives.Question Quality Pyramidal Structure
Questions on Stack Overflow are marked 'closed' if they are deemed unfit for the question-answer format on Stack Overflow and indicate low quality.By way of this feature    , reddit enables an individual create accounts in a matter of minutes without giving out an email address.Platform of Study 
The New York Times commenting system allows users to comment on articles online provided that they are logged into the site.Results show that TDT was positively correlated with usefulness    , meaning that TDT is a reliable indicator of usefulness; topic knowledge was not found to help in inferring usefulness.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within; LDOCE.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.4.4LDOCE 
The LDOCE data first gives the headword and part of speech; these two values hold for each subsequent sense.Additionally    , from the application of SCOVO in voiD we have learned that there is a demand for aggregates.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.In addition     , LDOCE uses a restricted vocabulary of 2000 words in the text of all of its definitions'.The reviews from NewEgg are segmented into pros and cons sections by their original authors    , since this is required by the website .Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Therefore    , questions on Stack Overflow which are extremely off topic or very poor in quality are deleted from the website 
Who can delete a question  ?.Reddit Reddit is composed of many different subcommunities called " subreddits " .We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.Surveys were first posted publicly to communities on Reddit    , Voat    , Hubski    , Empeopled    , Snapzu    , Stacksity    , Piroot    , HackerNews    , Linkibl    , SaidWho and Qetzl.The TDT 3 dataset roughly 35  ,000 documents was used as a preparation for participation in the trial HTD task of TDT 2004.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.The results of this experiment are shown in 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .However    , many <Inanimate' nouns are defined by substance in LDOCE.Then using FriendFeed 5 data    , we identified users who also have FriendFeed accounts.Estimation Accuracy: We compare our CLA size estimators with a systematic excerpt 
End-to-End Experiments
 To study end-to-end CLA benefits    , we ran several algorithms over subsets of Mnist480m and ImageNet.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.  , New York Times archive    , quantify concept occurrence for each time period e.g.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.Such tools will be applicable to MRDs other than LDOCE.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .The New York Times news corpus is collected to verify the model's general applicability.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.For example    , the Wall Street Journal and USA Today are the two newspapers with the lowest exponents    , indicating national interest    , with the New York Times close behind.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.For instance    , assume that a user is reading an article " After Delays    , Wireless Web Comes to Parks " of The New York Times.For instance    , New York Times articles are usually shared more than news articles from a local newspaper.Evaluation
Ideally we would like to evaluate our quality estimates against some ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.This way    , DataHub enables many individuals or teams to collaboratively analyze datasets    , while at the same time allowing them to store and retrieve these datasets at various stages of analysis.For example    , one of the study participants tried to share a New York Times article discussing high fat versus low fat diets with two of his coworkers .The first term is as in 
New York Times Articles N > 2 
We perform our approach on New York Times articles.Finally    , in step 5 the user then decides to document their analysis in the DataHub Notebook see Section 3.3 for details in order to share it with their team.Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.An explanation for this is that teasers often mention different events    , but according to the TDT labeling instructions they are not considered on-topic.Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.LEAD: This is a popular baseline on DUC2001 data set.Dataset Description

Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.We will use the New York Times annotated corpus 1 since it is readily available for research purposes.  , WikiWars    , WikiBios but also on the news that are compiled from a large source of news channels.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.We also find that some topics of deleted questions are entirely irrelevant to the Stack Overflow website.As a case study    , we collect a Chinese hotel review dataset from booking.com.Our performance comparison over the binary classification task from the SEMEVAL-2007 task shows that our 6 systems performed below the best performing system in the competition    , to varying degrees .Other Typical Nouns
 Several typical nouns in the produced thesaurus are also compared with markers of LDOCE.In the following    , we present current state-of-the-art approaches both available or unavailable in GERBIL.While developing GERBIL    , we spotted several flaws in the formal model underlying previous benchmarking frameworks which we aim to tackle in the future.University

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG

Structural Analysis
Our structural analysis of an HTML document is based on the key observations mentioned above.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.Reddit is also a home of subreddits like: ELIF Explain like I'm five    , TIL Today I learnt    , AMAAsk Me Anything etc.Stack

Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.Reddit http://reddit.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.Version Comparisons and Merging
DataHub allows datasets to be forked and branched    , enabling different collaborators to work on their own versions of a dataset and later merge with other versions.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.To address these use cases    , and many more similar ones    , we propose DataHub    , a unified data management and collaboration platform for hosting    , sharing    , combining and collaboratively analyzing diverse datasets.On FriendFeed users can comment and start discussions on the aggregated content    , similar to functionalities provided by typical OSNs.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.Three of the most accessible were the Merriam-Webster Pock& Dictionary MPD    , its larger sibling    , the Merriam-Webster Seventh Colegiate ~7 and the Longman Di@ionary of Contemporary English LDOCE.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.These 149 engines were a subset of the 157 search engines in the FedWeb 2013 test collection.Previous TDT research

Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.Data
The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.We conclude with a discussion of the current state of GERBIL and a presentation of future work.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.To assess word relatedness    , we use the WS-353 benchmark dataset    , available online 
G = {a1    , b1    , .In FedWeb 2014    , participants are given 24 di↵erent verticals e.g.For example    , if a document contains " New York Times " while the user types " ny times "     , typically the document would not be retrieved at a search system.On Reddit    , users employ subreddits to discuss everything from crochet to conspiracy theories.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.Actually     , defining vocabularies used in LDOCE and OALD are often used in some NLP researches.Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.This approach is similar to solutions for the TDT First Story Detection problem.Following the TDT evaluation requirement    , we will not use entire corpus at a time.Booking.com Baseline
We use the currently live ranking method at Booking.Good " radar returns are those showing evidence of some type of structure in the ionosphere. "While Celestial is a distinct    , freely-downloadable software package    , at Southampton University 
Citebase Search
Citebase    , more fully described by Hitchcock et al.We used the New York Times Annotated Corpus for our document collection    , which contains 1.8 million documents covering the period from January 1987 to June 2007.Interestingly    , the most popular forum among U. S. workers is Reddit HWTF while international workers are most likely to use MTurkForum.Previous work 
The tasks defined within TDT appear to be new within the research community.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.We assembled a corpus of 18  ,641 articles from the International section of the New York Times    , ranging from 2008 to 2010.The TDT cost function assumes a constant value of P rel across different topics to obtain the standard TDT cost function described above.The Lexrank value for a node pu in this case is calculated as: 
1 − d N + d v∈adju pv degv 
Where N is the total number of sentences    , d is the damping factor that controls the probability of a random jump usually set to 0.85    , degv is the degree of the node v    , and adj
A dictionary such as the LDOCE has broad coverage of word senses    , useful for WSD .Research Methodology
 We take advantage of a production A/B testing environment at Booking.com    , which performs randomized controlled trials for the purpose of inferring causality.The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.On Sonar and Ionosphere dataset    , the RNN-Uncertainty algorithm clearly outperforms the rest of the algorithms by a significant amount.  , the New York Times Annotated Corpus.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.The evaluation of our framework by contributors suggests that adding an annotator to  GERBIL demands 1 to 2 hours of work.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.They start out with a high comment-to-submission ratio relative to users in their cohort who abandon Reddit more quickly.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.Besides    , since we have sentiment labels on sentences from the NewEgg data set    , the sentiment transition indicator τ can be directly inferred.TDT corpora 
Results.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.The TDT-2 corpus has 192 topics with known relevance judgments.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.This result is gratifying in this merged document that has more than 246 transitions between sentences 
New York Times Articles
 This dataset contains articles written by four authors .We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.The sources of the stored documentation are thus very varied ; in the case of the existing prototype mediaeval history of France the sources include : original documents    , learned contemporary works    , articles from journals    , etc.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.Reddit allows for threaded conversations    , where users can comment over other comments.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection    , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 
 INTRODUCTION
A large and increasing number of people are using Web search engine to seek information today.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection
Evaluation.Bad " returns are those that do not    , their signals pass through the ionosphere.Reddit HWTF in particular displays a variety of features e.g.An interesting feature of reddit    , is the 'throwaway account'.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.These queries are listed in 
The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.In February 2012    , we extracted the list of 220 URIs available on the DataHub site under the " LOD cloud " group    , offering entry points for most of the datasets listed in the LOD cloud.The first phase captured the network of FriendFeed users    , while the second phase captured the activity of the users identified in the first phase over a period of five weeks.The dataset in 
Characterizing affixes 
The goal of this section is to explore the types of canonical affixes users on Reddit utilize.In the Reddit dataset    , the median article received 38 votes upvotes plus downvotes    , while the median Hacker News article received 21 votes    , with a minimum of 3 votes in each case.  , ignore the pros/cons segmentation in NewEgg reviews .It would be useful to search for objects using multiple pre-trained visual detection models    , such as a 200-class ImageNet Detection model and a 1  ,000-class ImageNet Recognition and Localisation model.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by

In the experiments described in this paper we used New York Times articles since 1870 for history.There are large numbers of tags and users; orders of magnitude larger than the 1  ,000 categories of ImageNet.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.This work is a preliminary exploration    , focusing on a set of high precision reddit communities    , however expanding to other subreddits is a ripe area of future research.APPENDIX
Full-life view for users in Reddit.TDT evaluations have included stories in multiple languages since 1999.Though not matching our wish list    , the TDT-2 corpus has some desirable properties.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.However    , participants were free to use any of the other Blog06 collection components for retrieval such as the XML feeds and/or the HTML homepages.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.New York 
Times.One might conjecture either that MTurkGrind has developed into an independent    , more socialized community partly from a pool of Reddit HWTF users    , or that MTurk- Grind has started to attract users from Reddit HWTF who seek more social interactions.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.In this paper    , we used the New York Times annotated corpus as the temporal corpus.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.The TDT1 corpus    , developed by the researchers in the TDT Pilot Research Project    , was the first benchmark evaluation corpus for TDT research.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.The 
MRD used is The Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English 
LDOCE.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.Both cases are part of our experiments in this paper and part of the TDT 2004 evaluations for AF.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.In Section 2 we discuss the TDT initiative    , its basic ideas    , and some related work.We first describe the Thrift-based API    , followed by the DataHub Notebook.All TDT tasks have at their core a comparison of two text models.Prominent examples include the archive of the newspaper The New York Times 
Related research is briefly discussed in Section 2.The reasons people read the news – and read The New York Times – colored their reactions to the TNR application.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Our principal argument is that simple bag-of-words based text classification models – which    , when coupled with sufficient data    , have proven to be extremely successful for many natural language processing tasks 
 We introduce the first version of the reddit irony corpus    , composed of annotated comments from the social news website reddit.In this work    , we use the New York Times archive spanning over 130 years.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.WikiWars 
 Abstract 
On the other hand    , we consider that if the benefit and feasibility of improvement plan could be shown to the developers quantitatively and several parts of the improvement activity are executed cooperi~tively with the developers    , they would be quite well motivated for process improvement.moviepilot provides its users with personalized movie recommendations based on their previous ratings.The overall average gap is 749 days since 2008    , when users on Reddit were first allowed to create their own communities.In 2013    , Jiaul H.

Discussion.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.As part of DataHub    , we are building a version browser to browse and examine versions    , as well as a version graph displaying how versions have evolved for both purposes: differencing and analysis of how versions have evolved    , and for merging versions.In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.A goal of the TDT pilot study was to test that definition for reasonableness.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.Answers and StackOverflow    , the Reddit dataset offers following unique advantages.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.Further    , we employ the New York Times Annotated corpus in order to extend the covered time range as well as improve the accuracy of time of synonyms.Agency Budget and New York Times News

CONCLUSIONS
 The TDT evaluation program assumes a constant for the probability that a story is on topic.BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.Orkut also offers friend relationship.Many alternatives to Reddit saw a substantial increase in their relative post and comment volumes; however    , the volume on Reddit was largely unchanged    , indicating that the events had minimal effect on Reddit itself.Analysis on Model Dynamics
This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.A research over TDT database 5 is being carried out.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.The exponential scoring function should help to avoid segmentations like " new york " " times " .To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.A statistical dataset in SCOVO is represented by the class Dataset; it is a SKOS concept 
Example.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.The earlier work is carried out under TDT evaluation.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.The better results between the two runs are shown in 
Comparisons among performance on different datasets
In Table 13    , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06    , 07    , and 08.For example    , we are more likely to observe " travel guide " after " new york " than " new york times " .Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.EXPERIMENTAL SETUP

CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.The other two AMA's are open to a more wider audience for sharing their life events and allowing other reddit users to ask questions related to those events.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.To compare users' behavior on Reddit with that on the alternative platforms     , we leverage the fact that many alternatives feature subreddits with direct analogs to those seen on Reddit    , e.g.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.Rel Doc Densities

Data Preprocessing -Content Extraction
Web pages are cluttered with distracting features around the body of a blog post which distract the user from the content block.For instance    , the engine might recommend The New York Times as a " globally relevant " newspaper    , and the Stanford Daily as a local newspaper.The data comprises comments scraped from the social news website reddit.The first is TDT 
Experimental Design
Three sets of experiments are performed in our study.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.Interestingly    , CMU    , the top performing group    , experimented with both types of index    , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.DataHub has three key components    , designed to support the above use data collaboration use cases: I: Flexible data storage    , sharing    , and versioning capabilities.SPARQL endpoint from DataHub in step i    , step ii extracts resource types and instances via SPARQL queries 5 that conform to the definition of resource types and instances in Section 2.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.Both Reddit and Hacker News display the current score of articles    , and thus provide a signal about how other users evaluated these articles.All

Questions were put to us concerning the accuracy and completeness of the LDOCE codes.Differences in Social Support 
Does the nature of feedback or social support from the greater reddit community also differ in the case of posts from anonymous accounts  ?SemEval Keyphrase Extraction Data
In addition to our four collections of index terms    , we used an existing dataset for keyphrase extraction evaluation — the SemEval-2010 keyphrase extraction data.WikiWars.For example     , The New York Times and Chicago Tribune provide different viewpoints in their coverage of stories on health care and national defense.FedWeb Resource Selection

In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.4 TDT aims at automatically locating    , linking and accessing topically related information items within heterogeneous    , real-time news streams.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.In addition to listing the citing articles    , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.The forum component of reddit is extremely active: popular posts often have well into 1000's of user comments .More information about this dataset can be found in 
The 
The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.In hearing about paper preservation " they think primarily in terms of mediaeval manuscripts    , precious editions and old documents.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.Another important kind is detecting new events    , which has been studied in the TDT evaluations.3 We evaluate our model and features on the ImageNet hierarchies with two different taxonomy induction tasks Section 5.  , by ranking them    , or featuring targets on the Reddit home page.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.It is desirable in TDT to have a cost function which has a constant threshold across topics.As the research is broadened to the larger TDT scope    , the unresolved questions become more troublesome.Some companies    , like the New York Times    , manually maintain a directory of entities and ask human experts to create links between their resources e.g.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.This simple assertion    , which we call the native language hypothesis    , is easily tested in the TDT story link detection task.For each post    , Reddit provides the difference between the number of upvotes and number of downvotes.4 This NIST policy was not made public at development time    , but we had chosen to create our own internal blog question test set from BLOG06 snippets that can serve as answers.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.To emulate this setting    , we consider potentially frame-evoking LUs sampled from the New York Times.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.They can thus make the choice to dissociate from their reddit identity by simply using an alternate pseudonym and then leaving it behind.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.The two metrics are as follows:

Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .The graphs are publicly available at Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 5 .We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor 
Results
On the SemEval-2007 data set    , the basic configuration of simplified Lesk SL+0—i.e.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.For English    , both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the MFS.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.The average blog entry in our BLOG06 index has 220 words.The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.DataHub has already been used by data scientists in industry    , journalists    , and social scientists    , spanning a wide variety of use-cases and usage patterns.Note that FriendFeed being an aggregation service enables us to study different services from one common observation point    , and allows us to get a unique " sneak peek " on how these social networking and content sharing services are being used by a common set of users.The NYT corpus is a random selection of daily articles from the New York Times    , collected by the authors and drawn from the years 2003-2005.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.These primers are designed using a known normal sequence called the reference sequence    , which has been imported into our database by the Function Express Server from RefSeq.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.We have built and described an evaluation corpus based on 22 topics from TDT news stories.If there are no conflicts    , merging can be done automatically    , otherwise DataHub will need to walk the user through the differences.We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users 
Dataset N K N GC k C D EF F D l 
Brightkite vides a public API to search and download these messages.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.Among them are ABC News    , Associated Press    , New York Times    , Voice of America     , etc.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB 
Comparisons.In comparison    , Reddit HWTF    , MTurkGrind    , and MTurk- Forum appear to be mostly dedicated to discussions about details of MTurk work.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.We feel that a TDT system would do better to attempt both of those at the same time.Aleph suffers from this problem starkly on the WebKB- Department task.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.Status    , in both in the Reddit community as well as the RAOP subcommunity    , turns out to be strongly correlated with success.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.The interviewer was careful to divorce himself from both Microsoft and The New York Times to make participants more comfortable with discussing the application freely.In particular we obtain ten-million tokens from 1788 New York Times articles from the year 2004.Finally    , dual citizens have activity on alternatives that was sustained for longer than one week    , but their activity is not consistently higher on alternatives than Reddit.Consider a news website such as New York Times.We also asked the assessors to compare the generated clusters with the TDT-2 topics and indicate if they agreed.We find this method is effective at recovering ground truth quality parameters     , and further show that it provides a good fit for Reddit and Hacker News data.Dataset
 Our dataset consists of a sample of Stack Overflow    , a Q&A Forum for programmers.This is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times that includes the article title    , byline    , publication date    , and URL.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.In contrast    , tourists exhibit a sudden burst in activity on Reddit alternatives and then no further activity there.Her own practice in her office with digital material was almost entirely of on-screen reading from her laptop; mostly of digital journals    , but also of online scans of mediaeval material.Conclusion 
We have presented    , to the best of our knowledge    , the first comprehensive study of mental health discourse on the social media reddit.TIMES NEWS READER APPLICATION
The Times News Reader application was a collaborative development between The New York Times and Microsoft.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.Notably    , they identify Reddit users as having a high propensity to move to alternate platforms.For example    , some reviewers will explicitly organize their reviews in pros and cons sections 1 ; and in NewEgg http://www.newegg.com/    , reviewers are required to do so.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .Hence    , we plan to add support for data aggregation in a future version of the SCOVO schema.The resuiting TDT corpus includes 15  ,863 news stories spanning July 1    , 1994    , through June 30    , 1995.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query.We select the check-in occurred during January 2010 to September 2010 from the original Brightkite 
Comparison Methods.  , mediaeval history.We recruited via Reddit 5  more than 2000 volunteers to install our extension.Conclusion
 Story link detection is a key technique in TDT research .For each word    , we construct the time series of its occurrence in New York Times articles.Macro-averaged Ctrk have been used as the primary measure with al = 0.1 and a2 = 1 in benchmark TDT evaluations.We use the Gerbil testing platform 
Evaluation metrics.SISE will only work if a topic is discussed on Stack Overflow.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems

DISCUSSION
 In order to gain more intuition on which cases TSA approach should be applied    , we provide real examples of the strengths and weaknesses of our methods compared to the state of the art ESA method.We can see that the performance on Blog-2008 is worse compared to Blog06 and Blog 07.  , Live Search    , Ask.com    , or AltaVista    , and contained either search engine result pages    , visits to search engine homepages    , or pages connected by a hyperlink trail to a search result page.For example    , NASDAQ real-time data feeds include 3  ,000 to 6  ,000 messages per second in the pre-market hours

EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS
We tested SugarCube on the Blog06 collection 
CONCLUSIONS
We analysed the Blog06 collection using SugarCube.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.Various celebrities and noteworthy personalities have used reddit as a means to interact with Internet users    , such conversations fall under the Ask-Me-Anything and its variant subreddits.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.Aleph is unable to find a good clause even after evaluating the maximum 500K clauses    , thus resulting in relatively worse performance on the WebKB-Department task than the WebKB-Student task.Commenting on aggregated content facilitates information dissemination in the FriendFeed network.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.Results on NASDAQ Dataset
 Figures 4b shows the performance of our model in comparison with the best baseline B3 over the NASDAQ.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.For example    , Reddit    , a famous social news site    , has mentioned in its official blog post 2 that this method is used for their ranking of comments.848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.We are also interested in understanding the characteristics of the FriendFeed social network and how they relate to the characteristics of the social network services that it aggregates.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.The results are shown in 
Reddit and Hacker News
Given that our model effectively recovers ground truth data from the MusicLab experiment    , we now evaluate the fit of the Poisson model to Reddit and Hacker News voting data.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.A TDT system makes its decision without any external input.While the definition of blog distillation as explained above is different    , the idea is to provide the users with the key blogs about 
Topics and Relevance Judgments
 For the purposes of the blog distillation task    , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection.To make a fare comparison across all the models    , ASUM and JST were also modified to utilize the annotated pros/cons sections in NewEgg data set during the training phase.'s augmented Group Average ClusteringGAC

 Introduction
Socially-curated websites such as Reddit depend on large communities for content creation and moderation 
The Reddit Controversy
 Reddit is the most popular exemplar 1 of a class of websites known as social content aggregators    , on which users can post new content as well as vote and comment on each other's content.We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.A FriendFeed user can choose to aggregate content from among the supported services into the user's FriendFeed profile page.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.We suggest it unnecessary to consider complicated hierarchies in the context of the state-of-the-art TDT techniques.However we cannot directly estimate the probability of receiving a vote versus not receiving a vote    , for both Reddit and Hacker News.Second    , posting is not affected by a confounding factor that commenting is subject to: Reddit influences commenting by how it presents potential targets for comments e.g.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.We find two interesting patterns in the topic trend of New York Times corpus.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.FriendFeed www.friendfeed.com is one such service.The third dataset is the second largest in Wikia    , Muppet    , whose articles are about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .Our data starts in October 2007    , but Reddit existed before that.The second source of information is trade-level data for over 8000 publically traded companies on the NYSE    , AMEX and NASDAQ exchanges.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.We obtained the transcripts of both events from the New York Times 2 .Lexvo 
Results and Discussion
 This paper presented preliminaries for the development of a generic OWL/DLbased formalism for the representation of linguistic corpora.In this query set    , the closest query vector to ytarget corresponds to the query "new york times".For BBC    , Dailymail    , and The New York Times we monitored their RSS feed daily from March to November 2014.The poor agreement between assessors on what constitutes a topic is not very surprising    , as debates on what topic means have occurred throughout the TDT research project.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.As small data sets    , we used A the full Rest subset 22  ,328  ,242 triples    , B an extract of the Datahub subset 20  ,505  ,209 triples and C an extract of the Timbl subset 9  ,897  ,795 triples 7 .We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.The weights of DNN are learned on ILSVRC-2010 1     , which is a subset of ImageNet 2 dataset with 1.26 million training images from 1  ,000 categories.Zhu    , Kraut    , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.Nevertheless    , in TDT domain    , we need to discriminate documents with regard to topics rather than queries.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.Third    , the way that comments are presented on Reddit makes scraping the complete commenting history rather difficult.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.  , non-overlapping clusters which together span the entire TDT corpus.TDT has been more and more important.Part of the top stories task is a collection of 102  ,812 news headlines from the New York Times.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.electric current."We begin with a simple aggregate query that counts the number of person mentions in one-million tuples worth of New York Times tokens.WWW2004    ,

 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.This research reveals how social media like reddit are fulfilling unique information and social needs of a cohort challenged with a stigmatic health concern looking through the lenses of disclosure    , social support    , and disinhibition.We created a script to extract questions along with all answers    , tags and owners using the Stack Overflow API.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Results

SIGIR 2007 Proceedings 
The Number of Factors
As we discussed in Section 3    , the computational complexity of each iteration for solving the optimization problem is quadratic to the number of factors.In the reddit dataset    , the responder in each IAmA is a single notable personality with average reply rate of around 10.16%.Of course    , user transactions on New York Times do not provide any information about why an item was consumed.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.For example    , for the category " staff " of the WebKB dataset    , the F 1 measurement is only about 12% for all methods.We described overall system performance using a bootstrap method that produced performance distributions for the TDT corpus.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com

Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.By mapping these communities     , when a user posts to an alternative    , we can identify how popular the corresponding subreddit would be on Reddit .Of the over 1000 nouns which had verb bases    , 712 were not already on the LDOCE fist augmented by Filtering.FriendFeed allows users either to filter by people or to use a form-based search tool 1 .Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.The quality of Reddit article is estimated as: 
Q i = λ sub · e qi · r up i − r down i  3 
We include the subscript in the λ sub term to emphasize that this constant is different across subreddits.We use the already segmented NewEgg reviews as groundtruth sentence-level sentiment annotations: we treat all sentences in the pros section as positive and all sentences in the cons section as negative.A FriendFeed user can " follow " the activity of other users of this service by subscribing them as " friends " .By selecting the New York Times Bestsellers    , it also helps focus on sampling a common set of users: avid readers of best-selling English-language books.This has proved to be not uncommon in LDOCE definitions.Reddit and each of the remaining 21 alternative platforms were crawled for all publicly available content.In our use scenario    , all the items in the " News " partition on the front page of the New York Times are links.Using the 2323 verbs from LDOCE we ran Filter on our taxonym fles    , and extracted 312 can.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.llowever    , it is not our intention to witch-hunt in LDOCE.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.We collect a set of companies 1 and their news articles from New York Times.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.Despite the hysteria concerning a mass exodus from Reddit    , our behavior trend analysis shows that no such exodus occurred    , though a small user migration was apparent.Experiments on DUC2001
In order to show the generalization performance of our model    , we also conduct experiments on another data set for automatic keyphrase extraction task and describe it in this subsection briefly.'lYaversing is-a relation    , for example    , a thesaurus has been obtained 
A program to extract key nouns and function nouns 
 4 Comparison between Result of Extraction and BOX Code 
The thesmlrus produced from LDOCE by the key noun and key verb extraction programs is all approximate one    , and    , obviously    , contains several errors.Experiments on two TDT corpora show that our proposed algorithm is promising.In this way    , the events that more traditional newsrooms like The New York Times found interesting are different from those that are interesting to newer newsrooms such as Buzzfeed or cultural media outlets such as TimeOut New York.The WikiWars corpus

1 1 = w     , 1 .The New York Times annotated corpus was a relatively new development and had not been extensively adopted for clustering experi- ments.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.The input data was 50 TDT English newswire clusters and each cluster contained 10 documents.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.A new DataHub app can be written and published to the DataHub App Center using our SDK via thriftbased APIs see Section 3.3.All three networks are downloaded from Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection 4 .More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.For the first time in the area of TDT    , we applied a systematic approach to automatically detect important and less-reported    , periodic and aperiodic events.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.The assessor then searched the Blog06 test collection to see if blog posts with relevant opinions appear in the collection.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.The datasets are available from the Stanford Large Network Dataset Collection SNAP    , http: //snap.stanford.edu.Since we lack the ability to evaluate against ground truth data from Reddit or Hacker News    , we evaluate this model on data from the MusicLab experiment.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as the TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.ELSA was evaluated with the New York Times corpus for fifteen famous locations.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .This is probably the reason that TDT annotators included the documents in the topic.The " Open Knowledge Extraction " challenge at ESWC 7 and frameworks such as GERBIL 
Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.A friend on FriendFeed is a unidirectional relationship.Lydia is capable of retrieving a daily newspaper like The New York Times and then analyzing the resulting stream of text in under one minute of computer time.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.The targets were free electrons in the ionosphere.
