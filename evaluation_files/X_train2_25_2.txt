We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.Instead of using proxy measures    , we preferred to let developers evaluate video fragments and their related Stack Overflow discussions.In

GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.To ensure our example repository is always current    , we also continually monitor Stack Overflow to parse new source code examples as they are posted.In WPBench    , user interactions are recorded when users are browsing a set of the most popular Web 2.0 applications.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.OpenStreetMap OSM maintains a global editable map that depends on users to provide the information needed for its improvement and evolution.In GitHub    , users have the option of watching repositories they are interested in.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.For this year's task is based on Billion Triple Challenge 2009 dataset.The KDDCUP 2005 winning solution included two kinds of base classifiers and two ensemble classifiers of them.Community Takes Long Time to Detect but Swift Action by Moderators
Stack Overflow delineates an elaborate procedure to delete a question.We denote such documents as partially-structured    , largely-naturallanguage PSLNL documents.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature    , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.Next    , we generate the XML format for our annotated corpus    , which is similar to the data format in SemEval-10 Task 10.Semantic Search Engine 
The dictionary for finding gene mentions was automatically derived from the full LocusLink database    , and included 156  ,533 genes with a total of 387  ,850 synonyms.The dataset is available for research at https://github.The representative words of them are mainly about programming languages php    , java    , python    , and tools github    , photoshop    , api.We also aim at improving the OpenStreetMap data usage scenario    , e.g.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.The WT2G collection is a 2G size crawl of Web documents.Location is based on GPS hardware in the mobile device or network location provided by the application    , and the map is based on data from the OpenStreetMap project.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .Although none of these sites are represented in the WT2g dataset    , we had to take this possibility into account.The OpenStreetMap project has successfully applied the Wiki approach to geo data.We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.Experimental results over Blog06 collection showed the advantage of using multiple opinion query positions in comparing the opinion score of documents.Lastly    , projects and developers on GitHub are searchable and browsable by different criteria.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.For WebKB dataset we learnt 10 topics.To ensure critical mass    , several programmers were explicitly asked to contribute in the early stages of Stack Overflow.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.The Blog06 collection includes 100  ,649 blog feeds collected over an 11 week period from December 2005 to February 2006.As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.While we recognized that GeneRIFs were    , like the rest of LocusLink    , publicly available    , we worked on the honor system of research groups not using GeneRIF data.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.Performance on OpenStreetMap Dataset
Scalability of Hadoop-GIS
Boundary Handling Overhead
We run the join query on PI dataset to measure the overhead in boundary handling step.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.RELATED WORK
Stack Overflow is a collaborative question answering Stack Exchange website.While the definition of blog distillation as explained above is different    , the idea is to provide the users with the key blogs about 
Topics and Relevance Judgments
 For the purposes of the blog distillation task    , the retrieval document units are documents from the feeds component of the Blog06 collection.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor 
Results
On the SemEval-2007 data set    , the basic configuration of simplified Lesk SL+0—i.e.Profile based features are based on the user-generated content on the Stack Overflow website.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap
Although one might expect that bloggers cite and leave comments on the blogs that are in their blogrolls    , we found that overlap between the different kinds of ties    , while significant    , is not complete.Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .BM25 slightly outperforms LM with Dirichlet prior on the WT2G collection.In order to publish the OpenStreetMap data    , we performed some preprocessing of the data structures.There are over 100 different badges on Stack Overflow    , which vary greatly in how difficult they are to achieve.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.Main experiments
In Table 1    , the results of Siamese CBOW on 20 SemEval datasets are displayed    , together with the results of the baseline systems.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.Data Set and Evaluation Metrics
Data sets
In this paper    , we use the data sets from the KDDCUP 2005 competition which is available on the Web 1 .The goal of Stack Overflow is to be the most extensive knowledge base of programming related topics.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .In order to enable DBCs on a larger scale    , we propose to simplify the GitHub collaboration process even more.By distributing tasks or questions to large numbers of Internet users    , these " crowd-sourcing " systems have done everything from answering user questions Quora    , to translating books    , creating 3-D photo tours

CROWDTURFING OVERVIEW
 In this section    , we introduce the core concepts related to crowdturfing .Ensemble of Classifiers
The winner of the KDDCUP 2005 competition found that the best result was achieved by combining the exact matching method and SVM.As we collected the clickthrough data    , we crawled all Web pages of the ODP http://dmoz.org/ directory about 1.3 million.A recent study showed that it is very difficult to improve opinion retrieval performance over a strong baseline on the Blog06 collection

The generated query with a runtime of 42 ms now contains a WITHIN preference for a polygon defining the administrative boundary of the 'Fatih' district as retrieved from the integrated OpenStreetMap data.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.Community based features are derived via the crowdsourced information generated by the Stack Overflow community.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.Answers or Stack Overflow    , attract millions of users.COM
Stack Overflow is centered around nine design decisions 7 : Voting is used as a mechanism to distinguish good answers from bad ones.First    , we prepare the training data and testing data    , including those GeneRIFs existed in LocusLink and the corresponding Medline abstracts." " % & v i v j 
Map copyrighted by OpenStreetMap and contributors    , CC-BY-SA and two vertices vi    , vj are joined by an edge displayed in black in the figure if they correspond to adjoining hexagons.To answer these questions we use data from Stack Overflow    , a CQA platform for programming-related topics.Such hierarchical sentiment analysis model is applied to the whole Blog06 corpus to generate an opinion polarity judgment list for all the documents    , combined with the corresponding sentiment strength within interval 0    , 1.INTRODUCTION 
GitHub 1 changed the way developers collaborate on social coding sites.In addition    , CodeTube searches and indexes Stack Overflow discussions relevant to each video fragment.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.The better results between the two runs are shown in 
Comparisons among performance on different datasets
In Table 13    , we show the MAP scores of our best runs on opinion finding and polarity tasks based on different datasets for comparison Blog06    , 07    , and 08.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.This outcome confirms a similar result obtained with a different collection the Blog06 collection    , where we applied query expansion selecting the pseudo relevant set with time distribution over documents 
 INTRODUCTION
A large and increasing number of people are using Web search engine to seek information today.To determine the probability that a GeneRIF would be found in a particular position    , we annotated a set of 200 MedLine entries from LocusLink associated with GeneRIFs.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.However    , the main source of information for me is Stack Overflow    , while video tutorials should be used to fix problems; if I need to apply a new technology    , I would like to start from Stack Overflow since there I can find snippets of code that I can copy and paste into my application.Coordination in Highly-Watched Github Projects.  , to verify the expertise of people publicly available forums such as Stack Overflow.With the advent of ecosystems like GitHub    , another tier of context-switching becomes possible: switching between projects.This dataset was also used in the prior work 
3 WEBKB Data.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Instead of artificially constructing Web content based on a model of typical Web 2.0 applications    , WPBench uses the real data from users' actually browsing and interacting with Web 2.0 sites.BENCHMARK DESIGN 2.1 Benchmark Requirements
WPBench Architecture
WPBench Generation
We selected 10 Web sites from the top 100 Web 2.0 applications for 2008 listed in www.webware.com    , which were voted by millions of Internet users.We used the corpus offered by Blogpulse for the Weblogging Ecosystem workshop 2006 2 to refer to a standardized set of texts.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.Our approach was based on using the WT2g dataset    , consisting of 247  ,491 HTML documents at 2GB storage requirements.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.However    , this information is not directly available in the publicly available data dumps provide by Stack Overflow .The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.Some of these queries have produced quite impressive results using the WT2g dataset and associated connectivity data.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.We also cannot make claims regarding generalizability beyond Stack Overflow.  , " Android development "  and ii a set of related tags T to identify and index relevant Stack Overflow discussions e.g.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.the speed of JavaScript engine 
In this paper    , we report the benchmark called WPBench Web Performance Benchmark that we have recently designed and developed to measure the performance of browsers for Web 2.0 applications.Accordingly    , the connectivity data was also distributed by ftp in a highly compressed format based on WT2g document numbers.We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.Answers and Stack Overflow allow people to meet their information needs by asking questions and receiving answers from their peers on a broad range of topics.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.The method of choosing the WT2g subset collection was entirely heuristic.For English    , both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the MFS.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.In particular    , OpenStreetMap OSM is an initiative for crowdsourcing map information from users.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.The results of the performance for the TSA algorithm with cross correlation distance function over WS-353 are presented in 
DISCUSSION
 In order to gain more intuition on which cases TSA approach should be applied    , we provide real examples of the strengths and weaknesses of our methods compared to the state of the art ESA method.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.  , OpenStreetMap or Open Government Data data    , a restaurant guide    , etc.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.We observed 56K topics in our dataset    , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow    , even though Quora is smaller by 
Questions and Answers.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.The WT2G collection is a general Web crawl of Web documents    , which has 2 Gigabytes of uncompressed data.Stack

Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.Road network N1 is obtained from OpenStreetMap and contain all roads    , while road network N2 is obtained from the Beijing traffic management bureau and contains only highways and main roads.The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.We detailed how it lets users interact with Stack Overflow documents in a novel way.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Their work found that higher levels of joint memberships between Wikia communities was correlated with success.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.The What block of 
CHARACTERIZATION OF DELETED QUESTIONS
 In this section    , we present our findings on deleted questions on Stack Overflow.The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.To describe those segments    , we rely on data gathered and distributed for free by OpenStreetMap OSM a global group of volunteer cartographers who maintain free crowdsourced online maps and by Ordnance Survey the national mapping agency for Great Britain.The Billion Triple Challenge 1 is a collection of crawled Linked Data that is publicly available and that is often used in Big Data research.Some examples of such data include organizational and personal web pages e.g    , the WebKB benchmark data set    , which contains university web pages    , research papers e.g.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.Our empirical results show that this strategy performs best when taking into account the costs of materialization    , both on Web Data Commons and on Billion Triple Challenge data.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.We observe similar trends in Quora.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.We also recall that questions on Stack Overflow are not digitally deleted i.e.Prior Interaction – Prior work on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Since the Web content    , user interactions    , and networking are exactly the same for these browsers    , WPBench produces benchmark results fair to different Web browsers.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.All figures are generated by our modified version of Java OpenStreetMap Editor 2 which is a map editor for OpenStreetMap 3 written in Java.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.Synonyms from genetic databases were sought to complement the set from LocusLink.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.The underlying theme of Stack Overflow is programming-related topics and the target audience are software developers    , maintenance professionals and programmers .In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.  , TER 
To validate our intuition    , we present series of experiments using the publicly available SemEval- 2016 Task 3 datasets    , with focus on subtask A.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.A new collection    , called Blog06    , was created by the University of Glasgow.Prototypical examples of PSLNL document collection include sets of conference information and seminar announcements.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.  , OpenStreetMap is about 300 GB.Validation Survey Respondents
1  ,207 GitHub users answered our validation survey.Therefore     , Stack Overflow has attracted increasing attention from different research communities like software engineering    , human computer interaction    , social computing and data min- ing 
DELETED QUESTIONS ON STACK OVERFLOW
In this section    , we briefly discuss about deleted questions on Stack Overflow.We filter out the photos that are not located in the city by latitude and longitude boundary as shown in 
Evaluation Measure
We extract a set of tourist attractions in the metadata of OpenStreetMap.The pages in Wikia sum up to more than 33 million .Besides    , we also plot the minimum bounding rectangles MBRs of tourist attractions for reference    , where the tourist attractions are collected from the metadata of OpenStreetMap.Impact on Voting
 Quora applies a voting system that leverages crowdsourced efforts to promote good answers.REFERENCES
 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.Interestingly    , CMU    , the top performing group    , experimented with both types of index    , and concluded that an index based on the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection leads to a better retrieval performance on this task.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.In the LocusLink lexicon    , entries are indexed by acronyms    , and each entry is a list of aliases that are only associated with the corresponding acronym but no other acronyms.Many PSLNL documents contain lists of items e.g.An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.Second    , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users.S3: TASKS IN OPEN-SOURCE SOFTWARE
 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.OKAPI BM25 function is utilized as TF part of weighting function 
Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware of using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.The use of LocusLink to expand the gene descriptions did improve effectiveness slightly    , as shown in 
Data Set Issues

Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.The code of this paper can be downloaded from http://github.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.From the sources we employed for knowledge-based query expansion    , the AcroMed database of biomedical acronyms produced expansions of highest quality     , outperforming both the euGenes and LocusLink genetic databases.For our experiments    , we use two real-life datasets WebKB and HIV    , and synthetic datasets Bongard    , which are summarized in WebKB 
Comparisons.This effectively creates a related question graph    , where nodes represent questions    , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora.First    , what triggers Quora users to form social ties  ?LIF achieved better recall and F1 than TF*IDF did on WebKB 
DISCUSSION AND RELATED WORK
In the various experiments presented here    , the proposed term weighting methods based on least information modeling performed very strongly compared to TF*IDF.While approaches to recommend Stack Overflow discussions exist 
Study results
Out of the 40 study participants    , 6 declared to have no experience in Android development.On the one hand    , the perceived relevance is relatively low    , with only 38% of the Stack Overflow discussions achieving a median relevance of 3.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.Answers and Stack Overflow form knowledge economies    , where users spend points to ask or boost the priority of questions and earn them for answering.The project is posted on GitHub 2 and we welcome usage    , feedback    , and contributions.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.The comparative results are shown in

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.For the WebKB task    , QuickFOIL explored on average 28K literals    , whereas Aleph constructed more than 10M clauses.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.These queries are listed in 
The AS3AP DB is composed of five relations.The tags were mainly used to learn about the topics covered by Stack Overflow    , while the question coding gave insight into the nature of the questions.We then give details on the key Quora graph structures that connect different components together.Further    , the samples came from a single repository Github    , and are all open source projects.We have evaluated the proposed method on the BLOG06 collection.KddCUP: The KddCup database is quite large    , but it contains large clusters of identical objects.Experiments
The implementation of our method is available on GitHub 1 .A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.Most notably    , we have only reported MAP scores for the MoviePilot data.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.The 17  ,958 splog feeds in the Blog06 collection generated 509  ,137 posts.WebKB: The WebKB dataset 3 contains 8145 web pages gathered from university computer science departments.Lastly    , we plan to integrate additional sources of information other than Stack Overflow    , towards the concept of a holistic recommender.Rel Doc Densities

OVERVIEW
Query Cases
There are five major categories of queries: i feature aggregation queries non-spatial queries    , for example    , queries for finding mean values of attributes or distribution of attributes; ii fundamental spatial queries    , including point based queries    , containment queries and spatial joins; iii complex spatial queries    , including spatial crossmatching or overlay large scale spatial join and nearest neighbor queries; iv integrated spatial and feature queries    , for example    , feature aggregation queries in a selected spatial regions; and v global spatial pattern queries    , for example    , queries on finding high density regions    , or queries to find directional patterns of spatial objects .Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.The WebKB dataset consists of 8275 web-pages crawled from university web sites.Accidental Question Deletion
Stack Overflow provides a procedure to undelete a deleted question.We make the following research contributions  We analyze deleted questions on Stack Overflow posted over ≈5 years and conduct a characterization study.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.Code- Tube also automatically complements the video fragments with relevant Stack Overflow discussions.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.Answers dataset    , which serves as a validation set    , we use the model trained on Quora dataset for performance evaluation.Experiments on the KDDCUP 2005 data set show that the bridging classifier approach is promising.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.EXPERIMENTS
Using the features described in Section 3.2    , we performed a set of experiments using a Q&A test collection extracted from Stack Overflow.We use a 10-fold cross validation process for performance evaluation for Quora dataset.GitHub Watchers.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.The Mean Average Precision MAP results for HGT and NIPS are shown in

The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.Study 2 S2 is a pilot survey that gathers data from 11 developers who asked Java cryptography-related questions on Stack- Overflow.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.For each input URL the server would respond with a list of incoming links from other WT2g documents and outgoing links.OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .In the end    , only 15.0% 54/360 of the factoid questions had an answer that could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; 24.8% 235/946 of the distinct items answering a list question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus; and at most 6.1% 45/735 of the distinct nuggets answering an Other question could be found only in the Blog06 corpus.Relation classification

Stability of Quora topics 
 In this section    , we shall perform stability analysis of the popular topics.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.Data
The Blog06 test collection includes a crawl of feeds XML    , associated permalinks HTML    , retrieval units    , and homepages during Dec 2005 through early 2006.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.However    , it was more convenient for us to download the most up-todate original OpenStreetMap data about Bremen    , available as Shapefiles 10 .The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier

Passage Retrieval
Since some pages are extremely long in the wt2g data set    , we became aware that using passages rather than whole pages as the indexing unit is appropriate for the sake of retrieval effectiveness.The BLOG06 corpus contains feeds ranking in size from just 1 or 2 posts to feeds with several hun- dred.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset

Baseline TimeLine extraction
In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.Since all insight sentences used in this paper were obtained from sets of ten Stack Overflow threads associated with an API type    , we would expect comparable results for any API type with at least ten threads on Stack Overflow.We plan to extend this work beyond the Java API and we plan to experiment with more features that capture the grammatical structure of sentences on Stack Overflow.We observe an increasing trend in the number of deleted questions on Stack Overflow over the last 2 years.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.Experimental Results 
The experiments were based on the Stack Overflow dataset described earlier.Basic biology includes isolation    , structure    , genetics and function of genes/proteins in normal and disease states

Publishing OpenStreetMap Geo Data
In addition to using Triplify for publishing RDF from the long tail of million of Web applications deployed    , we evaluated the software with the very large datasets produced by the OpenStreetMap project 14 .The  popular GitHub project Travis-CI 2 tries to automate continuous integration for GitHub projects and eases the testing effort.The code is available at https://github.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.To confirm this intuition we randomly sampled another set of URIs from dmoz.org a total of 10    , 000 URIs and parsed their content for the title.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.CONCLUSIONS
We conduct the first large scale study of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.We use a 482-class topic taxonomy from DMoz http://dmoz.org/ and a sampling and classifying technique that we will describe in §2.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.One of the issues that might need to be further investigated in this task is whether it is beneficial to use the Feeds component of the Blog06 collection    , instead of or in addition to the Permalinks component.All these browsers can browse all the Web sites in WPBench normally except that IE 8 beta and Firefox 3.1 beta cannot browse one of them due to unsupported features used by the Web site.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method

We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.Assuming we are correct about the use of qid    , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora and Stack Overflow     , by plotting qid against time.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.WebKB 4 Universities Data WebKB: This data set contains 8    , 282 web pages collected in 1997 from computer science departments of various universities    , which were manually categorized into seven categories such as student    , faculty    , and department.60% of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions or answers    , while less than 1% of active users post more than 1000 questions or answers.The two datasets are the WebKB data set
Methods
The task of the experiments is to classify the data based on their content information and/or link structure.To help assess generality    , we have begun to study OpenStreetMap    , a significantly different community.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.Analysis on Model Dynamics
This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.WWW2004    ,

 KNOWITALL is an autonomous system that extracts facts    , concepts     , and relationships from the web.Lucene was able to index the whole Blog06
Data Preprocessing -Content Extraction
Web pages are cluttered with distracting features around the body of a blog post which distract the user from the content block.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.Considering all the blogs in the BlogPulse data    , both in-degree and out-degree distributions have an unusually high number of blogs with degrees ranging from 10 to 500.However     , for each API type    , we considered ten different questions on Stack Overflow    , and for each question    , we considered up to ten answers.Firstly    , we classified trail pages present in into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month.Propagate the counts and pointers for the new leaves upward in the tree using the stack built in l    , and handle node overflow as in the insertion algorithm.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .The other two measures are defined according to the standard measures to evaluate the performance of classification     , that is    , precision    , recall and F1-measure 
F 1 = 2 × P × R/P + R 11 
" performance " adopted by KDDCUP 2005 is in fact F1.Having them together with video tutorials and Stack Overflow discussions would be fantastic. "We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Apart from existing as a question-answering website    , the objective of Stack Overflow is to be a comprehensive knowledge base of programming topics.To analyze the different kinds of questions asked on Stack Overflow    , we did qualitative coding of questions and tags.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink 
CONCEPT EXTRACTION.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.We collected the MEDLINE references as described before    , LocusLink has a set of references to MED- LINE documents relevant to the gene for documents corresponding to each organism in LocusLink.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.For blog distillation    , the Blog06 corpus contains around 100k blogs    , and is a Web-like setting with anchor text    , linkage    , spam    , etc.All current tableaux algorithm-based description logic reasoner systems stack-overflow when attempting to classify the basic extract of GALEN.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.Formal verifiers to guard for stack overflow and such will be very valuable.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.Experiment and Evaluation
Dataset
Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.Our preliminary findings indicate that Stack Overflow is particularly effective at code reviews    , for conceptual questions and for novices.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.We can see that the performance on Blog-2008 is worse compared to Blog06 and Blog 07.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.Therefore WPBench produces a fairer benchmark for different Web browsers.Harnessing Stack Overflow data
Seahawk by Bacchelli et al.In addition    , Stack Overflow consists of millions of questions with thousands of topics recall that there are 34  ,000+ tags.In general    , deleted questions are extremely poor in worth to the Stack Overflow community.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
For evaluating our methods    , we used WebKB datasets
We also test the accuracy of SimFusion algorithm.LocusLink 
LocusLink is most prominent source of publicly available information on genes.One is the absolute value of antonyms experimental result denoting antonymous degree that is shown in 
SemEval experiment
 The datasets of Evaluating Chinese Word Similarity task In SemEval 2012 is used as the experimental data    , of which the values are normalized as 
Conclusions and Future work
 This paper proposes a new approach for computing word similarity between Chinese words using HowNet.For example    , each insight sentence could be accompanied by an expandable widget which shows the entire thread on Stack Overflow from which the insight sentence originated.For example     , we find on Stack Overflow that users' votes on questions are significantly more positive before they receive the Electorate badge than after it.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Example Use Cases
Relations between Stack Overflow users.Sibling relationships were only identiied if the siblings and the parent that links to them were all present in the WT2G collection.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.SemEval Keyphrase Extraction Data
In addition to our four collections of index terms    , we used an existing dataset for keyphrase extraction evaluation — the SemEval-2010 keyphrase extraction data.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.The second example was a consequence of the emulator not checking for overflow of the control stack.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.From the PSLNL documents    , the system extracted 6500 data items on which our evaluation is carried out.The other condition codes returned by the stack operations include stuck overflow for Push and siaclc emp-ty for Pop and Top.The winning solution in the KDDCUP 2005 competition    , which won on all three evaluation metrics precision    , F1 and creativity    , relied on an innovative method to map queries to target categories.Dataset Description

Increase in Deleted Questions Over Time
 We now perform a temporal trend analysis of deleted questions on Stack Overflow.Collections currently available through Ensemble include the existing collections of AlgoViz Algorithm Visualization    , CITIDEL computing education resources 
Tools and Services
 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Quora and Stack Overflow
Quora.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.The question dataset stack overflow    , question  consists of 6  ,397  ,301 questions from 1  ,191  ,748 distinct users    , while the answer dataset stack overflow    , answer consists of 11  ,463  ,991 answers from 790  ,713 distinct users.We generate a dataset of URIs by randomly sampling URIs from dmoz.org and assume these pages to be missing.Threats to Validity
We selected our subject programs based on issues reported on GitHub.In this section    , inspired by KDDCUP 2005    , we give a stringent definition of the QC problem.By collecting bread crumbs from cell phones    , social media    , and participatory platforms    , researchers will increasingly rely on data sets orders of magnitude richer than previous urban studies data sets 
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We thank OpenStreetMap and all its contributors for making their data freely available.By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page    , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content.'Closed' questions are questions which are deemed unfit for the Stack Overflow format.Section 3.2.1    , we considered all the Stack Overflow users and their questions and answers.Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.The data provided by AcroMed 4     , LocusLink 5     , and UMLS 6 are processed to create three lexicons.
