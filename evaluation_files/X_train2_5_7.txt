Feature Impact Analysis
Results discussed thus far imply selectors are contributing information beyond that of the standard set of features.Starting in 2009 the NIST Text Analysis Conference TAC began conducting evaluations of technologies for knowledge base population KBP.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.We take as our benchmark the SemEval-2012 task on Measuring Degrees of Relational Similarity 
Model 
Comparison systems.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.  , features 7–12 in 
Evaluation
We evaluate our model on all six languages in the TempEval-2 Task A dataset 
TempEval-2 Datasets
 TempEval-2    , from SemEval 2010    , focused on retrieving and reasoning about temporal information from newswire.Keyphrase extraction is defined in the conventional way    , and was evaluated relative to the SemEval-2010 dataset.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.SemEval 2007 Web People Search Results
 The best system in SemEval 2007 obtained an Fscore of 0.78    , the average F-score of all 16 participant systems is 0.60.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.One is the absolute value of antonyms experimental result denoting antonymous degree that is shown in

 Introduction
In SemEval-2010 competition    , there is a sub task for temporal entity identification    , which includes a Chinese corpus.Task Description
There are multiple subtasks in SemEval 2013 and 2014.We used the input text as is which was stemmed    , for consistency with the published SemEval results.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.We bootstrapped this system by transferring the learned model from TAC KBP 2010 thereby circumventing the need for training examples.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.BRIGHTKITE.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset 
LSTM-based Hypernymy Detection
We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.Next    , we generate the XML format for our annotated corpus    , which is similar to the data format in SemEval-10 Task 10.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .The effectiveness of selectors is evaluated within supervised word sense disambiguation classifiers over the SemEval-2007 Task 17 
The workers loaded the port onto the ship this morning.Also    , we perform significantly better than other Semeval-2010 systems on the paired F-score metric.We even achieve superior performance for very short documents 6–8 words in the SemEval task as long as we can link to at least one entity.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.Introduction

SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.For the free parameters in our Sequential Dependence SD sub-models we estimate the parameters using training data from the TAC KBP 2010 entity linking data    , resulting in settings 
λ T D = 0.29    , λ O D = .21    , and λ U D = 0
 .50.The SemEval data is a collection of 244 scientific articles released as part of a shared task for keyphrase extraction  .In order to prepare our dataset for OSPC    , we chose the dataset of the TAC KBP 2009 Entity Linking competition    , as this dataset have been extensively used in Entity Linking evaluation.A full list of features and a complete description of the entity linking system is provided in our TAC KBP notebook paper.Parameters are learned using the back-propagation method 
Experiments
We compare DepNN against multiple baselines on SemEval-2010 dataset 
Contributions of different components
We first show the contributions from different components of DepNN.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.We score our systems by using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 official scorer    , which computes the macro-averaged F1-scores for the nine actual relations excluding Other and takes the directionality into consideration.More information about this dataset can be found in 
The 
The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.We also used an existing SEMEVAL-2013 set to create a similar test set for English both for adjective noun combination and noun noun combination .OpenStreetMap datasets are available in RDF format from the LinkedGeoData project 9 .This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .  , Brightkite 
The second example illustrates how distributing a dataset allows one to achieve a particular task    , while minimizing the disclosure of sensitive information.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset
