 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.ORKUT Data from ORKUT social network.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.A. Inter-worksheet Smells in the Euses Corpus 
1 Goal: During the first evaluation we want to learn more about the occurrence of the four inter-worksheet smells    , and hence focus on the question what smells are most commonR 1 .Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.This has resulted in a list of inter-worksheet smells    , which we have subsequently evaluated in both a quantitative study on the Euses corpus and a qualitative evaluation with ten professional spreadsheet users and real-life spreadsheets.In all    , there are 29  ,253 assertions acquired from Allmusic about the relational content such as <artist> <influences    , similar to    , follows> <other artists>.To conduct our scalability experiments    , we used the same Orkut data set as was used in Section 5.1.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.We manually validated the Allmusic ranking for a random selection of 100 artists that had multiple entries.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

 1 Precision: Using MinimalClusterSize 5 and MinimalDifferentValues 3    , which we consider the lowest meaningful values    , our algorithm detects 157 spreadsheet files in the EUSES corpus that contain clones.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.Interesting possibilities include exploiting all similar pairs for improving the quality of heuristic clustering approaches    , performing deeper social network analysis    , or in improving performance of related problems 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
We thank Ellen Spertus for her assistance with the Orkut data    , and Tim Heilman for his assistance with generating datasets for semantic query similarity.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.Once a user joins orkut    , one can publish one's own profile    , upload photos    , and join communities of interest.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Today    , the number of orkut users exceeds 33 million.A quantitative evaluation of the proposed clone detection algorithm on the EUSES corpus Section X.Allmusic Style Dataset
The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work is supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
This work was supported by the National Science Foundation under NSF grant IIS-0329090 and the EUSES consortium under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.A similar predominating position of this genre as well as was also reported by 
Allmusic Genre Dataset
The Allmusic Genre Dataset is provided as an unoptimized expert annotated ground truth dataset for music genre classification .We use 10 directed and 1 undirected orkut networks shown in 
Personalized PageRank computation and comparison to other algorithms.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.Our community membership information data set was a filtered collection of Orkut in July 2007.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.This paper makes the following three contributions: 
  We apply both algorithms to an Orkut data set consisting of 492    , 104 users and 118    , 002 communities.This step is optional described in detail in Section 4.2    , as we experiment with all classes of moods / themes from AllMusic    , as well as with a subset resulted from applying a clustering method on the original set.for the articles " AllMusic "     , an online music database    , and " Billboard magazine " are notable: Even though both articles are music-related    , they lack a direct connection to Elvis Presley.For example    , on the Orkut dataset a social network with only 117.2 million edges used in our experiment    , the state-of the art algorithm 
Challenge 2: High Computational Cost.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.Orkut also offers friend relationship.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.Around 5% of all spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus contain clones.The first part is conducted on an Orkut community data set to evaluate the recommendation quality of LDA and ARM using top-k recommendations metric.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.The second part is conducted on the same Orkut data set to investigate the scalability of our parallel implementation.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.For instance    , Obscuro subgenre is defined in Allmusic 1 as " .a nebulous category that encompasses the weird    , the puzzling    , the ill-conceived    , the unclassifiable    , the musical territory you never dreamed existed " .
