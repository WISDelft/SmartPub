Part of it reflects the ease with which computers can drown inexperienced users in material: for example    , of undergraduate searches on the University of California online catalog    , MELVYL    , those that retrieve any titles at all retrieve an average of 400.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.  , or Ask.com and were allowed to switch at any time.The statistics of title keyterms in the MELVYL-database are typical of many bibliographic databases    , and a similar a7.nalysis and approach can be used to develop es- timators for other predicate types such as term IN SUBJECT-KEYTERMS.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.Prime examples are the substance database PubChem 1 combining several chemical entity data sources and the document search engine ChemXSeer 2 .PubChem consists of 1 million graphs and is a subset of the PubChem chemical structure database 4 .  , PubChem    , social networks e.g.This approach is taken in the PubChem Compound Database http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov for users to search similar graphs for a given query graph.To do our first experiment    , we took a random 1‰ sample of the PubChem database resulting in around 48.000 chemical entities.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.For the experimental resulbs given here    , the set Q cont.ains 817  ,093 title keyterms t#hat were extracted from a sample of 885  ,930 MELVYL catalog FIND commands of which 326  ,511 referenced bhe title keyterm index recorded from public access MELVYL catalog termino.ls during part of 1986.For the large dataset    , we use a real chemical compound dataset referred to here as PubChem.  , Stanford University's FOLIO or the University of California's MELVYL or information vendors e.g.For the user study    , we have randomly chosen 10 query entities from PubChem    , each of them representing one feedback cycle inside the system.For example in the University of California's electronic catalog MELVYL 1 nearly half its 13 million title collection is non- English.We used synonyms from PubChem for chemicals that have been identified    , used simple entity recognition to extract information that is later used to increment or decrement weights of some terms and to filter out documents from the ranked list.The set D consists of the 951  ,008 different title keyterms that appeared in the MELVYL database as of December 12    , 1986.  , Live Search    , Ask.com    , or AltaVista    , and contained either search engine result pages    , visits to search engine homepages    , or pages connected by a hyperlink trail to a search result page.The most comprehensive open access database for the area of chemistry is PubChem 14 .To our surprise    , although gIndex is the oldest method among all representative graph indexing techniques we consider    , it performs the best for sparse datasets AIDS and PubChem since its pruning power is the best    , and thus    , the I/O cost is usually the lowest.To address this problem we used the PubChem SQL dump to store all entity data in a file based hash map.term InChI=1S/C5H8O/c1-2-4-6-5- 3-1/h2  ,4H  ,1  ,3  ,5H2 
cannot be found because the responsible entity in the original document could not be matched uniquely to the PubChem entities.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com 
¯ F x = 1 − F x = P X > x 
on log-log axes.PubChem has 23.98 vertices and 25.76 edges    , on average .The MELVYL catalog is described in detail in 
The value for n in the Zipf distribution model for each of the keyterm indices can be determined by observing that CARDI = UNIQUEI uaverage En    , number of occurrences of a value in or CARDZ/UNIQUEI = n/ H  ,.Nevertheless    , the experts in the chemical domain have provided a dictionary-based binary fingerprint for chemical structures in Pubchem dataset for similarity search.claims    , we chose a particular number of  
Chemical Entity Recognition and Query Expansion with Synonyms from PubChem
A distinct feature of chemical documents in general is the fact that chemical molecules in those documents can be represented in multiple textual ways    , and a simple keyword search would not suffice to have effective results.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.From those terms    , chemical entities are extracted and synonyms for the identified chemical entities are also included from PubChem.The similarity of two graphs is defined as the Tanimoto score of their fingerprints in PubChem.
