Due to the voluntary nature of GitHub c.f.For each query    , the lexicons are applied in the order of AcroMed    , LocusLink    , and UMLS for query expansion.Consequently the original datasets were left intact.TPC-W defines three different workload mixes: Browsing    , Shopping    , and Ordering.3 Three data sets were used in the experiments: two Chinese to English data sets on small IWSLT and larger corpora FBIS    , and Arabic to English translation.We observe similar trends in Quora.Experiment results on the benchmark dataset of SemEval 2013 show that    , TS- Lex outperforms previously introduced sentiment lexicons and further improves the top-perform system in SemEval 2013 with feature combination.In this part    , we evaluate the performance of all algorithms in similarity measurement on Douban dataset.In this experiment    , 500 points were labeled by each strategy on the CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets    , and the accuracy of the resulting models were measured.CADAL Book-Author Ownership Identifier    , which provides information about the relation between books and the author of the target book; 
2. Review Spider    , which crawls the related reviews from social websites such as DouBan; 
3.Thereafter    , we present the GERBIL framework.This task appeared at the Semeval 2007 and 2010 workshops .Datasets
 We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our model on SemEval-2007 dataset.The Gene Ontology GO describes the relationships between biological entities across numerous organisms.In particular the file directory and B-trees of each surviving logical disc are still intact.Interestingly    , since Merriam 1963 has more headwords than LDOCE    , many of the verbs we obtained from Filtering were quite esoteric.Gene Ontology harvest clustering methods.To the best of our knowledge    , this is the first formulation in the context of the standard set of LETOR features

SemEval Results
We ran DP-seg on the SemEval corpus of 244 fulltext articles.In this section    , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities.Introduction
Temporal relation extraction has been the topic of different SemEval tasks 
Related work
 The present work is closely related to previous approaches involved in TempEval campaigns

In this section we present a system that builds TimeLines which contain events with explicit time-anchors.Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers 
Votes on Super Users.F2000 must be physically intact bit stream preservation 2.We evaluate our method on the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , and achieve a state-ofthe-art F 1 -score of 86.3%.To this end    , we use GERBIL v1.1.4 and evaluate the approaches on the D2KB i.e.We crawled all Wikitravel pages of locations within the US    , starting with the page on the United States of America as the seed list.For instance    , http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/ is then an instance of http://dmoz.org/Computers/ Internet/History/People/Berners-Lee  ,_Tim/.Accumulating: Upon triggering    , window contents are left intact in persistent state    , and later results become a refinement of previous results.In those cases    , we kept the original POS tag NNS intact but used the singular gloss.Some resources we considered using are the Gene Ontology    , the Unified Medical Language System UMLS Metathesaurus     , and the Stanford Biomedical Abbreviation Server.We extracted a larger number of suggestions from Wikitravel pages on cities and towns in the US and created two systems that generate geographically independent rankings.EXPERIMENTS AND EVALUATION
Data and setup
We test our model on two subtasks from Semeval-2015 Task 10: phrase-level subtask A and message-level subtask B 1 .The list of the Web sites were collected from the Open Directory http://dmoz.org.These include 32 categories of data that occur most prevalently in the EUSES spreadsheet corpus's " database " section 2
 To evaluate usability    , we conducted a user study of the format editor in Toped and found that it enables administrative assistants and students to quickly and correctly implement validation 
As evidence of usefulness    , we have not only integrated the TDE with Excel and Visual Studio.On GitHub    , users' numbers of followers ranged widely from 0 to 1  ,321.We used LETOR 
OHSUMED: Pseudo Relevance Feedback
We compared the performances of Relational Ranking SVM and several baseline methods in Pseudo Relevance Feedback using the OHSUMED data set in LETOR.Density estimation 
 While the Gene Ontology GO categorizer estimates the relevance of each returned GO candidate term    , the density estimator provides a synthetic measure for each of the three axes.Here    , we train a Maximum Entropy classifier 6 for the preposition selection task on the FBIS corpus    , and rerun the classifier on the same data to collect the mistakes it still makes.In addition    , if the browser history is left intact for subsequent sessions    , the link colors will indicate which URLs in the result list were already visited.We collected over 30 thousand publicly available query posts from Quora and over 12 thousand publicly available query posts from YA for our study and experiments.In this section    , we introduce Quora    , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison.Quantitative Evaluation
 As for the same folksonomy dataset from Douban .com Movie    , we realize the baseline methods    , i.e.Each mini-evaluation has three parts: 
 INTRODUCTION
This paper investigates strategies to recommended travel destinations for users who provided a list of preferred activities at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Moreover    , all developers reported they felt comfortable—4 points on average on a 5-point Likert scale between very uncomfortable 1 and very comfortable 5—implementing the annotator in GERBIL.With 12 primaries    , ConfluxDB can produce almost 12 times the throughput of a single primary for the TPC-W workload.The values for N as well as its linear combination with VF were established based on the training set for each Gene Ontology axe.Experiments
Corpus & Evaluation Criteria
To evaluate our approach    , we applied the widely used test corpus of DUC2001    , which is sponsored by ARDA and run by NIST " http://www.nist.gov " .Note also that a musical time-scaling σ    , σ ∈ R +     , has an effect only on the horisontal translation    , the vertical translation stays intact.Aggregator b11  ,b12  ,.The code of the Primary Sources Tool is openly available https://github.While investigating the contribution process on GitHub    , it became clear that contributions were assessed by project owners.We collected blogs and profiles of 250K users from Blogger    , 300K users from Live- Journal and 780K users from Xanga.Each aggregate operation will create a new Value object while keeping the Key objects intact.The introduction of the well-known retrieval models introduced in the past decades can be found in many well written literatures such as 
General Pipeline
Our goal is set to design a system as simple as possible    , without using any external processing engine or resources    , other than the standard Indri toolkit and a third party LETOR toolkit.As mentioned in Section 4.1.1    , DUC2001 provided 30 document sets.Graph Structures In Quora
The internal structure of question-and-answer sites are often a complex mix of questions    , answers    , question topics    , and users.A strong improvement can be seen on the SemEval 2013 Task 12 dataset Sem13    , which is also the largest dataset.This particular setting was chosen based on a non-extensive set of experiments performed on the FedWeb'13 collection.Furthermore     , there is no corpus satisfying all remaining requirements     , so that we decided to use the WikiWars 
b Map-based visualization of event sequence with vt ≤ day for query in a. 
Temporal Evaluation
 As described in Section 5.1    , we use our temporal tagger HeidelTime    , which was developed for the TempEval-2 challenge where it achieved the best results among all participating systems for the extraction and normalization of English temporal expressions 
Geographic Evaluation
As for the temporal dimension    , we want to investigate the quality of the geographic dimension of events.JESTER 2.0
We adopt offline PCA and clustering in an effort to develop a more efficient and effective recommendation algorithm.Multiple LETOR methods have been tried    , which are different in many ways and we expect them to be complimentary during the final fusion.Douban.com provide a community service    , which is called " Douban Group " .For the proposed coordinate descent approach    , at each iteration    , we optimize only one label vector Fi * by leaving the others {Fj * |j = i} intact.We next conducted an online survey with 122 participants recruited through CraigsList in two major metropolitan areas.Time 
In contrast with the previous standard benchmark    , WS-353    , our new dataset has been constructed by a computer algorithm also presented below    , which eliminates subjective selection of words.For GitHub we selected the top ranked repositories    , i.e.If an acronym included in the expanded query can locate in LocusLink its aliases    , the aliases are included and their weights are equal to the weight of the acronym.Execution Strategies
We also evaluate the effect of different execution strategies on the TPC-W queries' response time.With binary refactoring    , the class structure in the program can remain intact but a split class refactoring can produce the same performance benefit.For Douban    , we separate actions on books and movies to derive two datasets: Douban-Book and Douban-Movie.The training data are tagged with POS tags and lemmatized with TreeTagger 
Evaluation measures
Evaluation in the SemEval-2013 WSI task can be divided into two categories: 1.The .senses of all the words in LDOCE call be defined by the KDV ill a series of four "defining cycles."We implemented the full TPC-W workload in SharedDB.Thus    , we ran experiments to measure this log merging delay using TPC-C and TPC-W queries.The TPC-W benchmark implements a fixed number of emulated browsers EBs that send requests to the system.On the other hand    , we found that only 10% of the analyzed GitHub projects implement some form of user authentication .To keep the data dependencies intact     , a more complex definition of ~ results    , which is given here without explanation for the amusement of the reader:  Applying improved array conditions to PC45    , 21 in figure 1 has the following effect.GitHub Watchers.A set of experiments is conducted on the DUC2001 data sets to evaluate our proposed method.Hence    , Douban is an ideal source for our research on measuring the correlations between social friend and user interest similarity.In the Shop.com dataset    , however    , we have both the product price information and the quantity that a consumer purchased in each record.Following the Gene Ontology terminology    , we call these narrow synonyms as opposed to exact synonyms     , such as acronyms.The first is in the context of attention rewards on user-generated content UGC based sites    , such as online Q&A forums like Quora or StackOverflow.The TPC-W metric for throughput is Web Interactions Per Second WIPS.We used the combined information in LocusLink and MEDLINE to identify the descriptors used to characterize the organisms for MEDLINE documents.With GERBIL    , we aim to push annotation system developers to better quality and wider use of their frameworks.University of Amsterdam Team

This systems extracts suggestions for sightseeing    , shopping    , eating    , and drinking from Wikitravel pages dedicated to US cities.We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus     , and then further test the performance of our method on a large scale training corpus.Experiments
In our experiments we used real data that were taken from the Billion Triple Challenge BTC dataset small crawl 6 .The evaluation    , conducted on the Task-12 of SemEval-2013    , shows promising results: our method is able to overcome both the most frequent sense baseline and    , for English    , also the other task participants.As also indicated in 
Parameter Sensitivity Study on LETOR 3.0
 As discussed before    , the starting temperature of the Simulated Annealing algorithm must be hot enough.In contrast to the WikiWars    , this corpus contains fewer event temponyms but features many temponyms that refer to temporal facts awards    , spouses    , positions held    , etc.on the Xanga dataset.Ro- bust04 is composed 528  ,155 of news articles coming from three newspapers and the FBIS.This work was funded in part by the National Science Foundation    , under NSF grant IIS-0329090    , and as part of the EUSES consortium End Users Shaping Effective Software under NSF grant ITR CCR-0324770.Furthermore    , we found that spreadsheets have an average lifetime of more than five years    , and individual spreadsheets are used by 13 different analysts on average 
C. Conclusions 
With the results of the Euses analysis and the case studies    , we revisit the research questions.For the datasets LabelMe and P53    , the queries are uniformly randomly chosen from the data objects.Even though small    , this evaluation suggests that implementing against GERBIL does not lead to any overhead.A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora    , identifying the most interesting and useful content    , i.e.Weights and cut-off values were determined from experiments on the FedWeb 2012 dataset.Additionally     , the MPD and w7 were the result of an extensive organization effort by a whole series of computational lexicologists who had refined its format to a very easily computed structural description Reichert    , Oiney & Paris 69    , Sherman 74    , Amsler and White 79    , Peterson 82    , Peterson 871 The LDOCE while very new    , offered something relatively rare in dictionaries    , a series of syntactic and semantic codes for the meanings of its words.The second collection is the largest provided by the Wikia service    , Wookieepedia    , about the Starwars universe.The integrity of these services is assumed to remain intact even in the event of a full DBMS compromise.BRIGHTKITE.The ConverSpeech ontology    , BioMedPlus    , is a federated    , language-oriented ontology constructed from LocusLink

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper    , we presented and evaluated GERBIL    , a platform for the evaluation of annotation frameworks.In Section 8    , we summarize the results of our experiments using the TPC-W and SCADr benchmarks.To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method    , we performed a systematic set of experiments using the LETOR benchmark collections OHSUMED    , TD2004    , and TD2003 and several evaluation measures MAP    , NDCG and precision .EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 4.1 Data Set
We use the DUC2001 and DUC2002 datasets for evaluation in the experiments.Partial data for those queries was obtained manually from the LocusLink and FLYBASE flybase.bio.indiana.edu databases.Second    , we with real-life spreadsheets the Institute of Software    , Chinese Academy of Sciences evaluation report in the EUSES corpus suffer which cover 21.6 putation smells reveal weakness and sheets.One transaction relates to exactly one action defined by the TPC-W benchmark.Triage task
The triage task is concerned with deciding whether a document merits manual classification in a gene ontology or not.We conduct experiments using the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.Model Selection The trail data of Semeval-2010 WSI task is used as development set for parameter tuning    , which consists of training and test portions of 4 verbs.In this way    , tile size of the KDV expands with each cycle until    , after three cycles    , all the words from the LDOCE controlled vocabulary are accounted for.EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY
 As it is commonly used in many topic classification studies     , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org ontology of the web to study the empirical effectiveness of our proposed approach.META SEARCH EXPERIMENTS

 This study addresses RQ2 by identifying cryptographyrelated tasks implemented in 100 public GitHub repositories.We set threshold at 0.5 for SemEval-2007 test set and 0.35 for Rappler test set    , empirically 6 .in software repositories such as SOURCEFORGE and GITHUB.To create the seed set for Xanga we took advantage of the concept of " metros " : each metro corresponds to a geographical region in which users locate themselves.3.i Key Verb Extraction Program 
Most of the definitions of verbs in LDOCE are described as: to VERB .In such an arrangement    , the na~asl revision is stored intact    , and deltas are used to regenerate older revisions .We evaluate our algorithm on the purchase history from an e-commerce website shop.com.In general    , since response times for TPC-C update transactions are lower than TPC-W update transactions    , our expectations that the log merging delay will also be lower as the timespan of the TPC-W transactions is longer is confirmed.We used the following data sets for our experiments: i GO-termdb Gene Ontology  at geneontology.org/    , ii IPI International Protein Index at ebi.ac.uk/IPI    , iii LMRP Local Medical Review Policy from cms.gov/medicare-coverage-database/    , iv PFAM protein families at pfam.sanger.ac.uk/    , and v RFAM RNA families at rfam.sanger.ac.uk/.By extracting a generic query for each theme defined as the most frequent terms of that theme    , we then characterize sentences in the latter by taking 12 features used in the Letor datasets 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We carried out experiments on DUC 2006 and DUC 2007 datasets 2 .Of these    , we focus on the SemEval 2014 Restaurants data ABSA.Quantitative Analysis
 In this paper    , we discus our systems' performances on the Semeval-2010 word sense induction/disambiguation dataset    , which contains 100 target words: 50 nouns and 50 verbs.This means that most of the friends on Douban actually know each other offline.In the course of our interviews    , several steps of the contribution process on GitHub emerged.We collected SVN repositories from Source- Forge as and Git repositories from GitHub.JESTER also employs a number of heuristics for the elimination of systematic errors    , introduced by the simulation of an actual parallel corpus as described before.These application servers carried out transactions following the Ordering mix defined by the TPC-W benchmark.These criteria    , also known as significant properties    , constitute the set of attributes of an object that should be maintained intact during a preservation intervention.If S were inconsistent    , this means that C was disjoint from some class D either inserted or left intact by S .The study was performed through a webpage mimicking the look-and-feel of the moviepilot website    , on this page users were presented with a random selection of movies they had previously rated    , with the ratings withheld.Answers    , Stack- Overflow or Quora.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

RESULTS MERGING
Evaluation
An important new condition in the Results Merging task    , as compared to the analogous FedWeb 2013 task    , is the requirement that each Results Merging run had to be based on a particular Resource Selection run.iii: Weighted Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain WNDCG: NDCG 
Results
We compared our models with four baselines and three benchmark systems from the SemEval-2013 task.The user-topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora.The amount of data and the length of the experiment are kept the same as in the TPC- W scale experiment described in the previous section.We have shown very competitive results relative to the LETOR-provided baseline models.To test interaction with Craigslist    , we search for and then post an advertisement.GitHub facilitates collaborative development through project forking    , pull requests    , code commenting    , and merging.In the distributed TPC-W system    , we use this object to manage catalog information    , which contains book descriptions    , book prices    , and book photos.Both task 1 of DUC2001 and task 1 of DUC 2002 aim to evaluate generic single document summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.Threats to Validity
One threat to internal validity of our evaluation is that we were unable to validate analysis results of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus by their original users.Experimental methodology

Analysis
 This section reports on post-submission experiments we performed to analyze the effects of various parameter settings.Resource Selection Task
The input for this task is a collection provided by the organisers FedWeb 2013 collection consisting of sampled search results from 157 search engines.Therefore    , we propose to reorder the article lists according to their relevance rankings    , while keeping the general layout framework intact.  , a huge collection of RDF graphs that was crawled by a Linked Data crawler like the Billion Triple Challenge dataset.Experimental Environment
The TPC-W benchmark models an online bookstore.Furthermore    , and compared to level b    , it leaves the data intact since there is no need to add any extra information about their provenance.on Wikitravel to local news and gossip on city wikis such as stadtwiki.net.Social Ties
We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users.Therefore    , the threshold can remain intact per data change    , which is not possible with a relative threshold e.g.,b1n .An overview of all parameters can be found on the GitHub page.We constructed 20 training topics from BlogPulse http://www.blogpulse.com/ and Technorati search http://www.technorati.com/ archives and manually evaluated the search results of the training topics to generate the training data set of 700 blogs.For better coverage    , post citations were collected using two search engines    , BlogPulse 
Link type overlap

Document Preprocessing
Before performing classification    , two document preprocessing operations were performed to extract more information from the full-text documents.YCSB+T transactional NoSQL benchmark
 Traditional database benchmarks like the TPC-W are designed to measure the transactional performance of RDBMS implementations against an application domain.EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND RESULT
 Since this paper focuses on the recommendation in ecommerce sites    , we collect a dataset from a typical e-commerce website    , shop.com    , for our experiments.Since Quora does not show when a question is posted    , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer.The second group of datasets corresponds to well-known LETOR 3.0 Topic distillation tasks    , TD2003 and TD2004 a.k.a.Genre information was obtained from Allmusic    , 10 which classifies artists and bands according to 21 coarse-grained genres and numerous subgenres.Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information    , previous questions and answers    , followed topics    , and social connections followers and followees.Leaves were fixed at 28 days after sowing and carefully flattened while keeping the leaf margin intact.Using large language model with and word co-occurrences    , we achieve a performance comparable to the systems in SemEval 2013    , task 13 
Relation Extraction
This task has not yet started    , because it relies on a contextualized corpus.The central database holding the orders themselves remains intact.For example    , the gene ontology data available at http://www.geneontology.org can be modeled as DAGs with nodes representing gene terms and edges denoting their is-a and part-of relationships.We have described an experimental method in which learnt uncertainty information can be used to guide design choices to avoid overfitting    , and have run a series of experiments on the benchmark LETOR OHSUMED data set for both types of model.Our experiments have been carried out    , over the same SemEval datasets    , with two methods that do not use labeled data for the target language combination .After that    , we design the experiments on the SemEval 2013 and 2014 data sets.TPC-W 10 : The TPC-W benchmark from the Transaction Processing Council 
Evaluation Platform
We run our Web based applications on a dynamic content infrastructure consisting of the Apache web server    , the PHP application server and the MySQL/InnoDB version 5.0.24 database storage engine.EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We first report the main experimental results comparing TSA to ESA on the WS-353 and MTurk datasets described above.Triples is an RDF benchmark resource description framework graph dataset from the billion triple challenge 6 .Experimentally     , we determined from 1P results that having between 400 to 800 clients for TPC-C and 250 to 500 clients for TPC-W generates load without underloading or overloading the primaries.Heavy Queries vs. Light Queries
 Next    , we analyzed the performance of the three test systems under two very different queries of the TPC-W benchmark.Data Description
We used the Letor 2 data collection 
Evaluation Measures
 In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms     , three evaluation measures are applied: Precision    , Mean average precision and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain 
18 
Mean Average Precision.The Billion Triple Challenge dataset was created based on datasets provided by Falcon-S    , Sindice    , Swoogle    , SWSE    , and Watson using the MultiCrawler/SWSE framework.Each document collection was first processed individually to generate single-word indexes of 244  ,458 terms and phrase index of 60  ,822 terms for FBIS    , 118  ,178 single and 28  ,669 phrases terms for Federal Register    , 290  ,880 single and 87  ,144 phrases terms for Financial Times    , and 228  ,507 single and 62  ,995 phrase terms for LA Times collection.Using our testing system we can examine web applications in detail to ensure that not only is the rendering not affected by security policy    , but the application functionality remains intact.We first discuss our baseline    , which is the current production system of the destination finder at Booking.com.Then we provide analysis of the importance of features and fields    , and the influence of different query types on LeToR models.Interviewees reported several examples where direct exchanges on GitHub helped diffusing testing culture.The code is available at https://github.In the case of LDOCE    , use of the defining cycles sorts out words in the LDOCE controlled vocabulary whose definitions include words outside of that vocabulary.We targeted the SemEval-2010 Japanese WSD task    , and showed the effectiveness of our proposed method.Data Categories in the Test Data
Each spreadsheet column in the EUSES corpus typically contains values from one category    , so columns were our unit of analysis for identifying data categories.GitHub tools and social features lower the barriers for engagement in software projects.We referred to the dbSNP online and found that the recorded position had two numbers in the form of <pos    , pos+1>.The FedWeb 2014 collection contains search result pages for many other queries    , as well as the HTML of the corresponding web pages.The rest of the order was preserved intact.For example    , if Q i is a gene    , E i would be a list of gene symbols found from LocusLink.In practice    , we run experiments on a subset of the LabelMe database; we segment each image into non overlapping regions    , and we describe each one using visual features including SIFT    , color histogram    , texton histogram and GIST.However    , 'literature' cannot be created if it never appears in the tags of Douban .com.To illustrate    , the following are the two lines of codes from LDOCE for the entry "admire"; there is one line for each sense in the dictionary entry.We also run the queries on SparkSQL    , since time is a column in the GitHub schema    , to compare performance.Experiment
Experiment Setup
 Data Our primary WSI evaluation is based on the standard dataset in Semeval-2010 Word sense induction & Disambiguation task .However    , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways.An example for the LocusLink lexicon is that the acronym " psen1 " corresponds to a list of aliases " ps-1    , pre1    , psen    , zfps1    , zf-ps1 " .that must have her mark intact.Algorithm 2 needs to use AcroMed and LocusLink databases for query expansion.LocusLink is used to find the aliases of the acronyms identified by AcroMed.Previous qualitative research on GitHub by Dabbish et al.Under this access pattern    , the system load distribution is highly skewed as shown in

Scalability of the entire TPC-W
 We conclude this performance evaluation by comparing the throughput scalability of the OTW    , DTW and STW implementations of TPC-W.The TPC-W benchmark measures the request throughput by means of emulated browsers EBs.Finally    , We have implemented Sapprox into Hadoop ecosystem as an example system and open sourced it on GitHub.The English-to-Chinese translation model was trained using the FBIS parallel text collection    , which contains 1.6 million parallel sentences.First    , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora  ?A threat to the external validity of our quantitative evaluation concerns the representativeness of the EUSES corpus.This year we experimented with the Wikitravel suggestion categories for buying    , doing    , drinking    , eating and seeing.In building PDEP    , we found it necessary to reprocess the SemEval 2007 data of the full 28  ,052 sentences that were available through TPP    , rather than just those that were used in the SemEval task itself.Participants
This research targeted users of GitHub    , a popular code sharing site.The dictionary we are using in our research    , the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE Proctor 781    , has the following information associated with its senses: part of speech    , subcategorizationl     , morphology    , semantic restrictions     , and subject classification.When no root is detected    , the algorithm retains the given word intact.We also evaluated our clusters arising from the distributional statistics    , in the Semeval-2010 tasks without any tuning and showed that they perform competetively with other approaches.The second corpus    , FBIS    , contains ∼240k sentences .The online version of GERBIL can be accessed at http://gerbil.aksw.org/gerbil.The average latencies were then measured during each 30-second period     , as shown in

The ECNUCS results merging run basedef simply returns the output of the official FedWeb resource selection baseline.We further augment the dictionary with terms of interest that are not present in FOLDOC    , in particular    , topics addressed by W3C standards.Wilks manually disambiguated all occurrences of the word 'bank' within LDOCE according to the senses of its definition and compared this to the results of the cosine correlation.In this paper    , we take the largest social based question answering service Zhihu in China    , which closely resembles Quora    , as the testbed.For example    , we decided to leave some clones intact because similarity level was not worth the effort of unification.Otherwise    , we leave the trees intact.We decided to pre-compute transitive closure table as is done in Gene Ontology Database as well.The experimental results provided in the LETOR collection also confirm this.Relevant graph partitioning techniques have been studied in areas such as web science 
APPLICATIONS
The clustering results along with the topics highlighted in the previous section indicate that AlgoViz users have clusters of interests when it comes to using online resources related to algorithm visualizations.The annotations were drawn using the LabelMe toolkit    , which allows for arbitrary labelled polygons to be created over an image 
Visual Dependency Representations 
Recall that each image is associated with three descriptions    , and that people were free to decide how to describe the action and background of the image.Answers 1 and Quora 2     , has become an important service due to the popularity of CQA archives on the web.In the absence of GPs    , a navigation step in a MashAPP is a single step in one application    , updating the corresponding PC node and keeping all others intact.UMLS is used to find the synonyms of the technical terms or phrases not recognized by AcroMed or LocusLink.The words in the sentences may be any of the 28  ,000 headwords in Longman's Dictionary of Contemporary English LDOCE and are disambiguated relative to the senses given in LDOCE.At the same time    , 
SCADr
We scale SCADr using a methodology similar to the TPC-W benchmark by varying the number of storage nodes and clients.GERBIL is not just a new framework wrapping existing technology.We computed Fleiss' Kappa to measure the inter-annotator agreement for this task    , obtaining 0.241 for the Quora topics     , 0.294 for the HF topics    , and 0.157 for the NYT topics.Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS 4.RESULTS ON DOUBAN.This result in itself is of high practical significance as it means that by using GERBIL    , developers can evaluate on currently 11 datasets using the same effort they needed for 1    , which is a gain of more than 1100%.WWW2003    ,

This team gathered attractions from Wikitravel and created vector representations of all the venues based on their titles and descriptions.Teachers also expressed differences in terms of whether they sought " intact " v. " customizable " resources    , and the types of resources e.g.2 Setup: In this evaluation we used the Euses Spreadsheet Corpus.In the quantitative evaluation we analyzed the occurrence of inter-worksheet smells in the Euses Spreadsheet corpus    , given the thresholds we have selected.The dataset is available for research at https://github.on dmoz.org most of them focus on the generation of references to include in own publications.The operative unit for selection into a sample was the message    , and any message selected was included intact parent email together with all attachments in the sample.For our example    , we can keep T1 intact and cut the common subtree from T2    , yielding T 2 = {mp}.The

 Existing resources and tools only cover some of the patron's needs.Craigslist allows users to view and post ads with very simple markup and formatting.We used the official SemEval task evaluation script to compute the Cohen's kappa index for the agreement on the ordering for each pair of candidates .By estimating the Wikitravel category for the provided examples    , we created personalised category prior probabilities.For example     , TPC-W 
Conclusions
We have presented a text database benchmark and a detailed synthetic text generator that can scale up a given collection of documents.Those features are then piped into different LETOR algorithms to produce several rank lists    , and eventually all the rank lists are merged using the conventional Reciprocal Rank based data fusion method.We leave the smaller leaf intact.In general    , terms directly related to gene or protein function appear to have the most promise based on the improvement of individual queries with the addition of data from Gene Ontology or SwissProt.Zhihu 1 is a social based question answering site in China    , which is similar to Quora in terms of overall design and service.  , BlogPulse and Technorati.Many " viral " videos take off on social media only after being featured on broadcast media    , which often follows their being highlighted on intermediary sites such as Reddit or Buzzfeed.Word alignment is performed by GIZA++ 
Experimental Results on FBIS Corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and the soft dependency matching model.Analysis of Individual Web Interactions
 The TPC-W benchmark involves a variety of different web interactions     , each involving a different set of queries.For the Chinese-to-English task    , the training data is the FBIS corpus news domain with about 240k sentence pairs; the development set is the NIST02 evaluation data; the development test set is NIST05; and the test datasets are NIST06    , and NIST08.Citebase holds articles from physics    , maths    , information science    , and biomedical science and contains over 200  ,000 publications.The dataset is the Billion Triple Challenge 2009 collection.In our experiments with the SemEval-2010 relation classification task    , when training with a sentence x whose class label y = Other    , the first term in the right side of Equation 1 is set to zero.Jester 2.0 went online on 1 " March 1999.This is because the LETOR data set offers results of linear RankSVM.EVALUATION
 We tested topes using the 720 spreadsheets in the EUSES Spreadsheet Corpus's " database " section    , which contains a high concentration of string data 
To evaluate how well these topes classified data as valid or invalid    , we randomly selected test values for each category    , manually determined the validity of test values    , and computed topes' accuracy.The replay time    , which is the time taken to transactionally apply the log record using the unmodified PostgreSQL hot standby feature constituted about 70% of the total latency for TPC-W queries while it is about 80% for TPC-C.The experimental results with the TPC-W benchmark showed that the overhead of Pangea was very small.WikiWars

EXPERIMENTAL SETTING
We conduct experiments on eight standard collections    , which include AP88-89 with queries 51-100    , AP88-90 with queries 51-150    , FBIS with queries 351-450    , FT91-94 with queries 301-400    , LA with queries 301-400    , SJMN1991 with queries 51-150    , WSJ87-92 with queries 151-200 and WT2G with queries 401-450.We assigned URLs in our dataset to categories in the Open Directory Project ODP    , dmoz.org in an automated manner using a content-based classifier    , described and evaluated in 
Long-Term Profile Generation
To identify searchers showing evidence of health-seeking intent    , we constructed profiles for a randomly selected subset of users who had visited at least one URL labeled with the category of the ODP 2 .In the rest of this paper    , we present and evaluate GERBIL.INTRODUCTION

Discussion.Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics.Data Set
 The DUC2001 data set is used for evaluation in our experiments .Out of these 15  ,000 posts from Quora were randomly selected for training and testing the model and 7000 posts from YA were randomly selected for model validation on a different platform.During the process    , most objects stay intact    , and only objects affected by the new arrangement move from stragglers to their new owners.First    , the F 1 score obtained on the Task 7 of Semeval 2007 and then the execution time.For comparative purposes    , considering that the Microsoft and LETOR datasets were designed for a folded cross-validation procedure    , we applied this same strategy to the YA- HOO!In 
Comparison with the state-of-the-art 
 We now compare the NLSE model with state-ofthe-art systems    , including the best submissions to previous SemEval benchmarks.To address this problem    , we aim to develop/implement novel measures into GERBIL that make use of scores e.g.We created a subset of the Newsvine dataset that includes only users with at least one friend and stories commented by such users    , etc.Although the produced thesaurus has several problems such as the difficulty of expressing disjunctive concepts    , the comparison between the produced thesaurus and semantic markers in LDOCE shows the possibility of sub-classifiCation of 'abstract' nouns.We also used the same term statistics computed from the FT92 collection The difference is    , that all the relevant documents from FT91 FT92 LA and FBIS were used for training.This is the focus of the rest of our paper    , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which    , if any    , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information.The third case occurs if WS is damaged but RS is intact.This result is higher than the overall we calculated for Github; we attribute this to the fact that the dataset generation process employs heuristics to detect merges in addition to those happening with Github facilities.The client side focuses on data visualization and user interaction while the server maintains the hierarchy tree for the Gene Ontology and sends back the selected portion to the client on demand.In this section    , we adopt Latent Dirichlet Allocation LDA 
Conclusions and future works 
With increasing popularity and quality control    , Quora has developed a rich knowledge base of Q&A.Using parallelization with 20 threads    , our model could be fit on our largest dataset RateBeer of 2 million total events within two minutes.In our experiment    , we use the source of fbis which only have 10  ,947 documents to train source-side topic model.This was developed based on the data gathered by Jester 1 .This database is expected to change quarter-yearly due to clustering by dbSNP.For the annotation task    , we combine three serial steps: passage selection; Gene Ontology categorization; density estima- tion.This initial experiment encouraged us to study and apply the singleton property in the management of metadata for ontologies such as the Gene Ontology.Another threat to external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of spreadsheets in the EUSES corpus and collected in our case study.Subsequently    , we were interested in understanding the challenges that contributors experience when working with the pull-based model in GitHub.Finally    , we also plan to study our approach on different languages and datasets for instance    , the SemEval-2010 dataset.recommender systems

This section examines the model dynamics with the SemEval-2 data    , which has been illustrated 890 with pseudo data in Section 3.2.Next    , we experiment with the extent that the algorithms can produce quality recommendations for groups    , using the MoviePilot data.This gives us a ranked list of Wikitravel pages for each city.The code used conduct these experiments can be found at https://github.  , a later labeled section has overlap with the previous labeled sections    , the previous labeled sections will always remain intact and the current section will be truncated.ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTAL RE- SULTS 
B.1 Overhead During Normal Operation 
 In this experiment    , we measure the overhead during normal operation for the TPC-C benchmark running on MySQL and the TPC- W benchmark running on Postgres.To evaluate the system performance    , we run the TPC-W on four architectures as illustrated in 
.To that end    , we propose an approach that anonymizes each tuple independently by perturbing SA values while preserving QI values intact.Over the course of 10 years the BeerAdvocate and RateBeer communities have evolved both in terms of their user base as well as ways in which users review and discuss beer.As a second future work    , we plan use our motif framework as a way to analyze other evolving collaborative systems    , such as non- Wikimedia Wikis    , such as Wikia and Conservapedia    , which have very different editing policies and user bases.To illustrate    , consider the following sentence    , from the SemEval-2010 relation classification task dataset

We present HypeNET    , an LSTM-based method for hypernymy detection.We trained 3 LDA models    , using the Mallet topic modeling toolkit: i with 500 topics    , on 600K Quora posts we crawled ii with 200 topics    , on 3M posts from health Q&A online forums    , and iii with 500 topics    , on a sample of 700K articles from the New York Times NYT news archive.The statistics of two data sets are summarized in 
Setup
With LETOR data    , since HP and NP are similar tasks but TD is rather different    , we conducted experiments on HP03- to-NP04 and NP03-to-TD04 adaptation    , where the former setting is for adapting to a similar domain and the latter for adapting to a distinct one.The question    , therefore    , will not be how and when the latter will take over    , but rather how parallel services can be kept intact    , and for which user needs either of the two models fits best.Craigslist has different sites based on geographic location and is similar to newspaper classified ads.We show that this substitution keeps intact the feasibility of the system.The preferred gene symbol was used for the canonical form and the synonyms were extracted from the LocusLink entry fields that contain the known gene or protein aliases used for the gene.The SemEval 2012 CLTE datasets used in our experiments are available for four language pairs: Es–En    , De–En    , Fr–En    , and It–En.Answers is a question-centric CQA site    , as opposed to more social-centric sites such as Quora.Here    , we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3  on " Community Question Answering "     , focusing on subtask A Question-Comment Similarity only.It was concerned with the classification of articles from four major categories    , including alleles of mutant phenotypes    , embryologic gene expression    , tumor biology    , and gene ontology GO annotation.DATA PROCESSING
The dataset for the ELC task is the Billion Triple Challenge dataset 2 .Overall    , the developers reported that they needed between 1 and 4 hours to achieve this goal 4x 1-2h    , 1x 3-4h    , see  either the same or even less time to integrate their annotator into GERBIL.The prepared statements were issued based on the frequencies defined by the TPC-W Browsing mix.To select the appropriate passage     , we use the GeneRIF extractor 
Gene Ontology categorization 
The selected textual passage is then sent to the Gene Ontology categorizer.In particular    , we train a separate classifier for each preposition using only training examples that are covered by the confusion set    , a setup similar to the NegL1 system as described in 
Data
As the ground-truth for our experiments    , we use the NUS Corpus of Learner EnglishNUCLE 
The non-ESL corpus used for constructing confusion sets is the Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , which is a Chinese-English bilingual corpus.LOCATION DISAMBIGUATION
We crawled TripAdvisor.com    , Hotels.com    , and Booking.com.The news site Newsvine uses a similar concept     , where a user's " vine " image represents their history and tenure with the site.An SAR in the anonymized data set may then only appear in the form     , where may contain intact sensitive items and possibly generalized non-sensitive items    , and is a non-generalized sensitive item.But using the claim we see that any such D that was inserted must have had negative AtomicScore    , as would any D left intact.TPC-W defines three transaction mixes: browsing    , shopping    , and ordering mixes.This is the information given by the Gene Reference into Function GeneRIF data in the LocusLink database    , a database of biological information created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information.Discussion
Orientation can be determined based on word    , phrase and hierarchical phrase 
Experiments
Experimental settings
Our baseline system is re-implementation of Hiero    , a hierarchical phrase-based system 
Experimental results on FBIS corpus
We first conduct experiments by using the FBIS parallel corpus to train the model of both the baseline and our lexicalized reordering model.The proposed model outperforms the top system in SemEval-2013.In Quora    , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers.3 For client-side projects    , we select from the most popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.The remaining words ill LDOCE is expected to be defined ill the next defining cycle.BrightKite is a now defunct location-based social networking website www.brightkite.com where users could publicly check-in to various locations.We perform experiments on users of Booking.com where an instance of the destination finder is running in order to conduct an online evaluation.DUC2001 provided 309 news articles for document summarization tasks    , and the articles were grouped into 30 document sets.Experimental Subjects
The EUSES corpus consists of 4  ,037 real-life spreadsheets from 11 categories.Component refers to cellular structures common to all cells and they are taken from and cross-reference to the cell component hierarchy of the Gene Ontology.On GitHub    , 9 interviewees said they were for hire; 18 said they were not.During this data processing    , we dropped 292 users who did not have full set of 50 artists that were classified by Allmusic and listened to more than 100 times by the user.For example    , the TPC-W workload has only 14 interactions     , each of which is embodied by a single servlet.6o Using Semantic Codes in LDOCE 
Methodology
Our goal in the second study was to use the LDOCF    , list of 2323 verbs said to select for human subject as the basis to discover other verbs which select for human subject.We plan to implement the Semantic Dictionary master by providing each of the semantic dictionary handlers with a portion of LDOCE.The code to calculate MRR is included in the GitHub repository for this paper.The value of entities that were updated only by dependent transactions is left intact .To address this challenge    , we classified the Web pages sourced from each context into the topical hierarchy from a popular Web directory    , the Open Directory Project ODP dmoz.org.Let us consider Gene Ontology GO
A Web Service Application
Similarly    , web service applications can also utilize the ONT_RELATED operator to match two different terms semantically.In Table 6 we see the distribution of Wikitravel categories over the top 5 retrieved suggestions and over all suggestions in the index.But this then requires a system to adopt LDOCE senses    , even when they are ineomo pletc or incorrect.We evaluate our model on the SemEval 2007 Coarse-grained English All-words Task  test set.Many high-profile music sources like iTunes and Spotify currently use Allmusic to handle relevant artist information.Gobblin was open sourced on Github as of February 2015.A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow    , and a dataset crawled  from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users    , questions     , topics and votes.lnformation about verbs    , such as "button"    , which pemfit an underlying object to appear as stibject might bc implicit in LDOCE.b evaluate the quality of the noun part of the produced thesaurus     , it is compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.GRIF: 12482586—eIF4E is associated with 4E-BP3 in the cell nucleus and cytoplasm GRIF: 11959093—Mutations in the S4-H2 loop of eIF4E which increase the affinity for m7GTP .However     , the EUSES corpus is a large set that is collected from practice and has been used for numerous spreadsheet papers.Instead    , we used the Open Directory Project ODP    , also referred to as dmoz.org.In this section    , we discuss this improvement by examining the values of features extracted for instances in the SemEval-2007 experimental corpus.Our manually-constructed disambiguation index is publicly available on the GitHub page.The database defined by the TPC-W benchmark contains 8 different data types e.g.with improbable movements and expr In the following part of this s&tion    , the comparison betwee~ semantic markers of LDOCE and the thesaurus constrn&ed ti:o~    , ~he definitions of nouns in LDOCE is discussed ikon~ ~;he view Nouns rdated to the concept animate have a relatively rumple st  ,nctnre in the thesaurus    , us auimat~ is often used ~s an example :d ~¢ the~uaar~_s.like system.  , Brightkite

 INTRODUCTION
Build    , the process of creating software from source code    , is an essential part of software development.Due to the community effort behind GERBIL    , we could raise the number of published annotators from 5 to 9.Background 
In this evaluation    , we used spreadsheets from the EUSES corpus 
C. Setup 
 To reach our goal    , we ran our data clone detection algorithm on those 1711 spreadsheets    , for different values of the MinimalClusterSize and MinimalDifferentValues parameter.Experiment and Evaluation
Dataset
Our WSI evaluation is based on the dataset provided by the SemEval-2013 shared 13th task.When tested over SemEval-2007 Task 17 and Senseval-3 English Lexical 
Sample    , we found that word sense disambiguation classifiers utilizing selectors performed significantly better than those without.  , 
 Extensibility: GERBIL is provided as an open-source platform 2 that can be extended by members of the community both to new tasks and different purposes.First    , PPD identified a One Lane Bridge OLB in the TPC-W application deployed in Setup A.We also consider the possibility of keeping all the tensions intact and keeping the 6th/7th note.We conduct our experiments on the commonly used SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset

Conclusions and Future work
 This paper proposes a new approach for computing word similarity between Chinese words using HowNet.4 GitHub integrates many tools into the project con-text and centralizes many interactions and notifications among project participants.This tokenizer employs a fine-grained tokenization that breaks on just about any non-number-internal punctuation     , but leaves alpha-numeric sequences intact.Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers.Douban is collected from a Chinese social network 
Experiments with Synthetic GAPs
We first evaluate our proposed algorithms using synthetic GAPs.The EX column in 
Runtime Overhead
Running AmCheck over the whole EUSES corpus took about 116 minutes.Suppose that user ui has n explicit social connections in the Douban dataset    , then we will choose the most similar n users as the implicit social connections in this method.All project code is available in a Github repository at https://github.com/medusa-project.Entries in FOLDOC contain a natural language description of the terms being defined and may also include hyperlinks to other entries in the dictionary.The first one is the widely used WS-353 dataset 
Vector 
Linguistic Vs. Distributional Vectors
In order to make our linguistic vectors comparable to publicly available distributional word vectors    , we perform singular value decompostion SVD on the linguistic matrix to obtain word vectors of lower dimensionality.We use MERT 
 1 Using the BTG system to perform force decoding on FBIS part of the bilingual training data 5     , and collect the sentences succeeded in force decoding 86  ,902 sentences in total 6 .Data Sets
For our empirical analysis    , we use the different segments of the data set provided for the Billion Triple Challenge BTC 2012.Performance was worse than in the EUSES case    , since in this analysis    , all clones of all files had to be compared with each other    , since we were searching for clones between files too.Answers    , Ask.com and Quora on the Internet.NDCG leaves the three-point scale intact.For all these reasons    , GitHub has successfully lowered the barrier to collaboration in open source.After generating a search    , Citebase allows the results to be ranked by 6 criteria: citations to the article or authors    , Web hits to the article or authors    , date of creation    , and last update.To this end    , we provide two main approaches to evaluating entity annotation systems with GERBIL.We have chosen to crawl the Newsvine site    , among dozens of other available news sites    , since: 1 Newsvine is relatively easy to crawl due to the static HTML nature of its content pages; and 2 its registered users constitute a social network that is publicly visible.Finally    , each Quora question has its own page    , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This paper reports on large-scale experiments with four different approaches to rank travel destination recommendations at Booking.com    , a major online travel agent.Two similar predicates    , and     , represent the concept that i should be linked to the with the largest number of corresponding gene ontology terms entity's function or tissue terms entity's location found in the context.The retrieval performance achieved was at least as good as the LETOR 4.0 baselines.Based on the User Disagreement Model UDM    , introduced in 
These were estimated from a set of double annotations for the FedWeb 2013 collection    , which has    , by construction    , comparable properties to the FedWeb 2014 dataset.Using normalized hyper-parameters described in Section 2.6    , the best hyper-parameters are selected by using the validation set of CIFAR-10.Since the majority of Quora profiles contain hundreds of posts    , to ensure that proper care is given to evaluating them    , we collected the judgements employing 19 students from our institutions.Usually VERB in tlfis pattern expresses a 'key concept' of the defined verb.However    , we observed that in some cases    , software projects are organized into multiple separate repositories on GitHub.In addition to listing the citing articles    , Citebase provides a summary graph of citations and downloads e.g.Measure 4: Text Similarity
One would hope that the text is preserved reasonably intact when transforming a text document.Quora manages such kind of topic categories for some of the popular topics 6 .As our benchmark    , we selected the recent SemEval- 2012 task on Semantic Textual Similarity STS    , which was concerned with measuring the semantic similarity of sentence pairs.More information about this dataset can be found in

The SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset is already partitioned into 8  ,000 training instances and 2  ,717 test instances.INTRODUCTION
Combining evidence from multiple sources has been studied in various contexts 
.This latter is the only one of interest for us: 
The AS3AP Benchmark Test Queries
 We have chosen the AS3AP benchmark for our performance tests due to its completeness in comparing relational systems with vastly different architectures and capabilities over a variety of workloads.We have subsequently evaluated data clones in two ways    , with a quantitative evaluation on the EUSES corpus and two real-life case studies in which we found that data clones are common and can lead to real errors.We have tried using Support Vector Regression RankSVM with linear kernel for pairwise LETOR    , and were trained on a set of error pairs collected using the " web2013 " relevance judgments file.In Section 7.1 we directly compare the approaches on the basis of its results achieved with GERBIL.The source code is available at the official Github repository .Our experiments on LETOR 3.0 benchmark dataset show that the  NDCG-Annealing algorithm outperforms the state-of-theart algorithms both in terms of performance and stability.  , or user u agrees with most of opinions issued by user v. This relationship is unilateral    , which means user u trusts user v does not necessarily indicate that user v will also trust user u. 
Douban Friend Dataset
The first data source we choose is Douban 1 dataset.This set of user information includes 95  ,270 unique GitHub user accounts.Hence these lower bounds remain intact when k is a constant.Data Sets
For our experiments    , we have worked with the Billion Triple Challenge 2 BTC from 2012.Data Sets
The CIFAR-10 data set contains 60  ,000 tiny images that have been manually grouped into 10 concepts e.g.Settings for the Experiments
Our simulator and TPC-W testbeds 
 We conducted experiments on two testbeds    , both implemented in Java.If the cost is zero we continue to the next iteration and keep w t intact    , hence w t+1 = w t .We chose subject programs by looking at bug reports for popular JavaScript projects on GitHub.For example    , the token allwatchers gives rise to the 5- grams " allwa "     , " llwat "     , " lwatc "     , " watch "     , " atche "     , " tcher " and " chers "     , whereas info is kept intact for n = 5.We acknowledge the support of the following organizations for research funding and computing support: NSERC    , Samsung    , Calcul Québec    , Compute Canada    , the Canada Research Chairs and CIFAR.To prevent errors 
in later steps    , we have to make sure that the structure of the text is intact.The two metrics are as follows:

Document Summarization
Experimental Setup
In this study    , we used the multi-document summarization task task 2 in DUC2001 for evaluation.Three benchmark systems as the following are those which achieved better results in the original SemEval-2013 task.D. Threats to Validity 
A threat to the external validity of our evaluation concerns the representativeness of the Euses Corpus spreadsheet set.For the purpose of this study we will employ data from two large beer review communities BeerAdvocate and RateBeer.We also report accuracy of the most frequent sense MFS baseline    , which always chooses the sense which occurs most frequently in SemCor 
Results
On the SemEval-2007 data set    , the basic configuration of simplified Lesk SL+0—i.e.The crawled and concatenated text of each of the 5 Wikitravel categories served as document representations    , which we indexed using Indri.Craigslist.Data: In our current experiments    , we used standard phrases from a generic WikiTravel http://wikitravel .org/en/wikitravel:phrasebook_template tourism phrase book as input elements.We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data    , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison.For English    , both implementations outperform the SemEval-2013 participants and the MFS.The Metanome project is an open source project available on GitHub 2 .The evaluation results indicate that our model outperforms or reaches competitive performance comparable to other systems for the SemEval-2013 word sense induction task.For Jester    , which had a high density of available ratings    , the model was a 300-fold compression.We note that 
Ontological knowledge
To get a better insight into the shortcomings of ESA on WS-353    , we calculate Spearman ρ for the WS-353 set minus a single pair    , for every pair.2 Douban 5 book data 
Experimental results
CONCLUSION
In this paper    , we propose a generic framework to integrate contextual information into latent factor models.This means that some LocusLink entries not only share PMIDs  ,but – rather surprisingly– annotations as well.Dmoz: A cut was taken across the Dmoz http://dmoz.org/ topic tree yielding 482 topics covering most areas of Web content.To show our methods can substantially add extra temporal information to documents    , we compare our methods to well known HeidelTime tagger by running the both methods on WikiWars and WikiBios datasets.We estimated the threshold for the clustering algorithm using the ECDL subset of the training data provided by SemEval.For example    , DB2 is a direct descendent of System R    , having used the RDS portion of System R intact in their first release.We use TPC-W benchmark    , which simulates a bookstore Web site.Comparable corpus
In this paper    , we generate a comparable corpus from the parallel Chinese-English Foreign Broadcast Information Service FBIS corpus    , gathered from the news domain.BACKGROUND
Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users.If it is    , we need to categorize the document into one or more of the three Gene Ontology categories: biological processes    , celluar components    , and molecular funtions.The first dataset was crawled from the Newsvine news site 1 .For RSVM    , we can make use of its results provided in LETOR.  , comparing different LSTM structures     , architecture components such as hidden layers and input information    , and classification task settings    , we use the SemEval-2010 Task 8.This is because the approach builds up lexical material from sources wholly within LDOCE.We implement our algorithm on Hadoop; the code can be found on GitHub.Other tables are scaled according to the TPC-W requirements.,bln Ra Features Regressor 
EXPERIMENTS
To evaluate our ranker selection approach    , we use the LETOR 3.0 dataset 
 In terms of MAP    , RankBoost is the best individual ranker    , followed by FRank and Regression.As the FBIS data set is large    , we employed 3-processor MPI for each Gibbs sampler     , which ran in half the time compared to using a single processor.Bias-Variance Decomposition of Error 
According to the bias-variance decomposition of error 
METHODS
Data sets
For our experiments we work with three public data sets: TD2004 and MQ2007 from LETOR data sets 
Evaluation Metrics
For model comparison we use two information retrieval metrics: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain NDCG 
N DCG@k = N −1 k j=1 grjdj    , 
 where N −1 is a normalization factor chosen so that a perfect ordering of the results will receive the score of one; rj denotes the relevance level of the document ranked at the j-th position; grj is a gain function: 
grj = 2 r j − 1; and dj denotes a discount function.We study a dataset collected in September 2009 which includes the whole Brightkite user base at that time    , with information about 54  ,190 users 
Dataset N K N GC k C D EF F D l 
Brightkite vides a public API to search and download these messages.It is helpful to the work of conducting the GeneRIF in LocusLink database.For example    , for LSH projections GRH+NPQ gains a relative increase in AUPRC of 60% over NPQ and 28% over GRH on CIFAR-10.Second     , we use the full 2012 NIST Chinese-English dataset approximately 8M sentence pairs    , including FBIS.Since no reader of LDOCE cml understand the meaning of these verbs only from the dictionary    , these may be a kind of bug of the dictionary.We now investigate the relation between the number of followers of a user and his/her contributions to GitHub.2 dbSNP build 130 SNPChrPosOnRef database 2 .We collected genre and subgenre information for each artist using the API for Allmusic 7     , a wellknown music database DB.To alleviate this problem    , GERBIL allows adding additional measures to evaluate the results of annotators regarding the heterogeneous landscape of gold standard datasets.The FBIS topics were: 189 584 relevant    , 695 non-relevant documents    , 301 339 relevant    , 433 non-relevant documents    , and 354 175 relevant     , 715 non-relevant documents.The TPC-W benchmark models a Web shop    , linking back to our first use case in Section 2.Results for TPC-W and for MySQL can be found in Appendix B.Since the number of relevant documents for each topic is generally low    , all the available relevant documents from FT92    , FBIS    , LA and FR are selected.2 Each query produced a set of documents corresponding to a LocusLink organism.In the experiment in disambiguating the 197 occurrences of 'bank' within LDOCE    , Wilks found a number of cases where none of the senses was clearly 'the right one' Wilks 891.The length of sequence can be of great interest in many datasets; for example    , it represents how actively a user enters reviews on BeerAdvocate and RateBeer    , how popular a phrase is in NIFTY    , or the skill of a player on Wikispeedia.Our experiments use data from the Gene Ontology database 
We discuss related work in Sec.To remedy this problem    , a number of organizations have been working on annotating each gene of model organisms with a controlled vocabulary organized as a Directed Acyclic Graph    , called Gene Ontology GO terms    , based on the contents of the published scientific articles.We perform three experiments using different sets of features and evaluate the incremental performance improvement on Quora dataset.We use two workloads    , TPC-W and TPC-C    , in our experiments.Upweighting of positive examples: no w = 1. dimacsAp5w5: Representation: Paragraphs    , selected using Locuslink information.According to a recent survey of Quora users 
Impact on Question Answering
Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network shown above into a tradition Q&A site.An example of artificial class is the class Other in the SemEval 2010 relation classification task.A twofold evaluation of the proposed inter-worksheet smells    , first on the Euses corpus    , and secondly with 10 professional spreadsheet users in an industrial context Section VIII.The source code for the implementation is available from GitHub 1 .Informed by previous work    , we generate hypotheses to test in our analysis of contributions in GitHub.Although all words in LDOCE or OALD are defined by 2  ,000-3  ,000 words    , the size of a Japanese defining vocabulary may be larger than English ones.In addition to the evaluation of individual detection strategies     , we applied PPD to a 3rd party implementation of the well established TPC-W benchmark.In this section    , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user-topic graph    , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities.This ensures that each symbol in x is either substituted    , left intact or deleted.In this section we discuss the design and evaluation of the key distributed objects in the distributed TPC-W system.The initial revision is stored intact and can be extracted quickly    , but all other revisions require the editing overhead.The Gene Ontology consists of 3 separate vocabularies -one for each of biological process    , cellular component and molecular function.EXPERIMENT DESIGN
 For our experiments    , we use version 3.0 of LETOR package provided by Microsoft Asia 
EXPERIMENT RESULTS
Comparison of NDCG-Annealing Algorithm with Baselines in LETOR 3.0
We compare our proposed NDCG-Annealing algorithm with those baselines provided in LETOR 3.0.Despite their different topics of interest    , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity.Those functions    , however    , tend to overfit the given rating set R and are likely to degrade on the complement of R. 
USER STUDY
In order to empirically estimate the magic barrier    , a user study on the real-life commercial movie recommendation community moviepilot 4 was performed.One is the WWW2006 Weblog Workshop dataset from BlogPulse    , which has 1  ,426  ,954 blog URLs in total    , and 1  ,176  ,663 distinct blog-to-blog hyperlinks.However    , we have found little evidence    , at least for the LETOR OHSUMED data set    , that explicit use of the uncertainty information can improve model performance in terms of NDCG.Experiments
Data Preparation
 Our experiments are on Chinese-English translation based on replications of hierarchical phrasebased system 
Results on Small Data
 To test the effect of our approach    , we firstly carried out experiments on FBIS corpus    , which contains 230K sentence pairs.  , CIFAR-10 1 and NUS-WIDE 2 .Semantic Search Engine

Temporal relation extraction is the problem of extracting the temporal extent of relations between entities.After compensation    , even though the initial value of e is restored by the first case of the definition     , the indirect effect it had on e' is left intact by the second case of the definition.Xanga treats email addresses differently: users can provide their email address to Xanga    , and visitors can use the website to send email    , without the address being visible directly.In the hundred relation most of the attributes have exactly 100 unique AS3AP benchmark: the storage organization of the relation and the selectivity factor of the query.We select the check-in occurred during January 2010 to September 2010 from the original Brightkite 
Comparison Methods.To study the effect of q which is the length of NBC for each projected dimension    , we evaluate our MH methods on 22K LabelMe and 100K TinyImage by setting the q to three different values 2    , 3    , and 4..To repair a ous computation smell existing work on appropriate formula pattern in an array that suffers We evaluated our lyzed the EUSES corpus putation smells can formance of our smells.Therefore     , we use the descriptions from the 50 examples and the 21  ,872 Wikitravel suggestions to assign the 50 examples to the 5 Wikitravel categories.In AlgoViz we used the results in two ways: 1 within the content recommendation block that suggests a list of entries based on the DSN analysis results and 2 within the ranking function that generates the ordered list of entries for users during browse and search operations.Furthermore    , the Newsvine friendship relations are publicly crawlable.We use the Gerbil testing platform 
Evaluation metrics.Probably the best known and most widely used ontology is the Gene Ontology GO    , a Directed Acyclic Graph DAG of terms describing the function    , biological role and sub-cellular localisation of gene products.Jester then generates the list ofjokes to be recommended to the user and presents them to the user in the aforementioned fashion.Data for the application scenario has been generated from an OpenStreetMap dump of the Istanbul area including administrative boundaries augmented by information from tourist websites such as tripadvisor.com and booking.com.In both cases    , for any given time span    , if an entry E in AlgoViz received a certain number of views within a cluster whose topics were highly related to that of E    , then E would be weighted more compared to other entries of similar type.In contrast    , the complexity bounds remain intact when LQ is CQ or the class of identity queries Corollary 1.Quora and Stack Overflow

 INTRODUCTION
A study conducted last year based on data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that there are currently as many as 11 million end-user programmers in the United States    , compared to only * This work is partially supported by the National Science Foundation under the grant ITR-0325273 and by the EUSES Consortium http://EUSESconsortium.org.We chose five document sets d04    , d05    , d06    , d08    , d11 with 54 news articles out of the DUC2001 test set.To analyze the semantic relationships between queries    , we assign each URL to a topic distribution over 385 categories from the second level of " Open Directory Project " ODP    , dmoz.org with a contentbased classifier 
IMPROVING THE MODEL WITH WEAK SUPERVISION SIGNALS
The bestlink SVM proposed in Section 4.2 is a supervised clustering algorithm that requires full annotation of tasks in the query log.E-commerce Dataset Description
We adopt the consumer purchasing records dataset from Shop.com 1 for model evaluation    , because an important information source leveraged in our framework is the quantity of product that a consumer purchased in each transaction     , which is absent in many of the public datasets.We present here performance evaluations of TPC-W    , which we consider as the most challenging of the three applications.First    , we analyzed a subset of the EUSES corpus 
IX.Coordination Mechanisms on GitHub.Data collection
We use the Billion Triple Challenge BTC collection 3     , a publicly available Semantic Web crawl; we consider this collection as a reasonable sample of Linked Open Data LOD.First we present experimental results to validate the correctness of the two heuristics of our algorithm and then we present results on the generated plans of two well known workloads     , the TPC-W and the TPC-H benchmarks.Apart from studying resource selection and results merging in a web context    , there are also new research challenges that readily appear    , and for which the FedWeb 2013 collection could be used.100% of the records arrived intact on the target news server    , " beatitude. "If suggestions from outside the context cities are geographically irrelevant    , we should focus on finding other sources for suggestions in those cities where few are provided on Wikitravel.We find that 10.4% of common hotels from Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , 9.3% from Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com    , exhibit significantly different rating characteristics    , which is usually a sign of suspicious behavior.Users on Douban can join different interesting groups.For recommender systems which present ranked lists of items to the user    , We computed the average error for Jester 2.0 algorithm across the
 Introduction
In Chinese    , most language processing starts from word segmentation and part-of-speech POS tagging .848 hotels were matched across all three sites    , 1007 between Booking.com and Hotels.com    , 655 between Booking.com and TripAdvisor.com    , and 10  ,590 between Hotels.com and TripAdvisor.com.We evaluate our Pyxis implementation on two popular transaction processing benchmarks    , TPC-C and TPC-W    , and compare the performance of our partitions to the original program and versions using manually created stored procedures.Conclusion
The extraction of semantic relations between verbs and nouns from LDOCE is discussed.Experimental results    , obtained using the LETOR benchmark    , indicate that methods that learn to rank at query-time outperform the state-ofthe-art methods.EXPERIMENT
Data Sets
To evaluate the effectiveness of our MH method    , we use three publicly available image sets    , LabelMe 
Baselines
As stated in Section 3.3    , MQ can be combined with different projection functions to get different variants of MH.Our experiments with two applications from Ask.com indicate the proposed techniques can effectively reduce response time and improve throughput in overloaded situations.Introduction
Semantic Relatedness and Corpora
Semantic relatedness describes the degree to which concepts are associated via any kind of semantic relationship 
Evaluation of Results    , WS-353 Test

Our Approach
By closely examining word pairs that failed to be ranked correctly by ESA    , we came to the conclusion that the WS-353 word pairs belong non-exclusively to four classes    , corresponding to different kinds of semantic relatedness and requiring different kinds of knowl- edge: 1. encyclopedic: see Section 2; 2. ontological: see Section 3; 
3. collocational: see Section 4; 
pragmatic: see Section 6.Each vertex represents a protein and the label of the vertex is its gene ontology term from 
Synthetic Data Sets
 In this portion of the experimental studies    , we analyze the performance of SAPPER    , BSAPPER and GADDI by independently varying each of six parameters on a set of synthetically generated graphs.Datasets
For the Relevance Feedback experiment    , we used the LETOR testbed 
Experimental Setup
Algorithms
To examine the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for ranking refinement    , we compared the following ranking algorithms: Base Ranker: It is the base ranker used in the ranking refinement.ConfluxDB relies on the update transactions in the workloads in particular    , TPC-C and TPC-W used for our experiments to touch only rows with a particular key e.g.Experimental Setup
Dataset and Evaluation Metric
 We use the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset to perform our experiments.In particular    , we experiment LogBase with TPC-W benchmark which models a webshop application workload.However    , no shuffle is needed at level 1 because the entire SIMD registers xmm4    , xmm5    , xmm6    , xmm7 remain intact going to the next level.We then give details on the key Quora graph structures that connect different components together.Main experiments
In Table 1    , the results of Siamese CBOW on 20 SemEval datasets are displayed    , together with the results of the baseline systems.The intuition behind depth-pooling is that most relevant documents appear at the top of the ranked list and therefore depth-k pools contain most of them 
 StatAP sampling stratified random sampling: StatAP sampling 
 When the properties of the above document selection methodologies are considered    , one can see that infAP creates a representative selection of documents    , statAP and depthk pooling aim at identifying more relevant documents utilizing the knowledge that retrieval systems return relevant documents at higher ranks    , the LETOR-like method aims at selecting as many relevant documents according to BM25 as possible    , hedge aims at selecting only relevant documents    , and MTC greedily selects discriminative documents.TPC-W benchmark models the workload of a database application where OLTP queries are common.We ran the exposure generation step only on the 1000 most-watched Rails applications on Github.Companies like Pandora and AMG Allmusic employ dozens of professional music editors to manually annotate music with a small and structured vocabulary of tags.Since GERBIL is based on the BAT-framework    , annotators of this framework can be added to GERBIL easily.The naive approach would be to consider each GitHub repository as its own separate project.A sentence classifier was built using GeneRIF entries in LocusLink excluding those that were in the secondary .txt file and their abstracts.bl1  ,bl2  ,.Xanga also allows users to " lock " their blogs    , which makes the blog visible only to a selected group of people.Datasets
 To evaluate the quality of our methods for temponym resolution     , we performed experiments with three datasets with different characteristics: WikiWars    , Biographies    , and News.LabelMe 4 .Our second testbed is a deployment of the TPC-W benchmark 7     , with the following details.We chose the EUSES corpus because it is by far the largest corpus that has been widely used for evaluation by previous spreadsheet research studies.MOLECULAR FUNCTIONS For this category    , we used the appropriate subtree from the Gene Ontology 6 .We summarize the relationships between different entities in 
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users.The third dataset is the second largest in Wikia    , Muppet    , whose articles are about the TV series " The Muppet Show " .As with TPC-W    , all data is replicated on two servers for increased availability.Three one-class classifiers using three different features stems    , bigrams and trigrams are linearly combined to get a final binary decision: relevant or not relevant for Gene Ontology annotation.Social Data
 As mentioned in Section 4    , the Newsvine site has a dedicated social network among its users.In fact    , it is as hard as finding the optimal joining plan

Scaling the financial service of TPC-W
The denormalized TPC-W contains one update-intensive service: the Financial service.For the Jester dataset with 100 items    , 9000 users and k = 14    , time to construct the factor analysis model was 8 minutes.RQ1: 14% of repositories are using pull requests on Github.As we argue next    , BeerAdvocate and RateBeer exhibit multiple features that make them suitable for the analysis of linguistic change.EXPERIMENTS
Experiment Settings
 Datasets: To evaluate our model's recommendation quality     , we crawled the dataset from the publicly available website Douban 1     , where users can provide their ratings for movie    , books and music    , as well as establish social relations with others.Ask.com has a feature to erase the past searches.Category 
GitHub Data 
GitHub is a Git repository service used by millions of people to collaborate on open source software projects.Moreover    , the code segments of the OS and DBMS are automatically guarded    , so they are intact.We focus in particular on how annotators and datasets can be added to GERBIL and give a short overview of the annotators and tools that are currently included in the framework.For our experiments    , we derive our local genre hierarchy based on the taxonomy of music genres developed by Allmusic 1 .He wants what he has done so far to be intact when he returns to his original task.Zhu    , Kraut    , and Kittur 2014 examine community survival as a function of multiple memberships within Wikia communities.In our experiments    , we concentrate on the query execution part of TPC-W.Procedure
For the first two studies    , we recruited participants using Craigslist.Introduction
We have participated all the three tasks of FedWeb 2014 this year.The source of the gene information was the curated genes represented as NLM's LocusLink LL database .Nonetheless    , the results of this paper remain intact when similarity predicates are used along the same lines as value equality.All of them used GitHub and many worked on private and / or open source projects.We now look at the relationship between coordination and status on GitHub    , keeping our discussion more brief for this dataset.To answer these questions    , we experimented with the Gene Ontology database 
Experimental Details
Primary Dataset The primary dataset is GO    , that we described in the introduction.To evaluate the quality of the produced thesaurus    , the noun part of the thesaurus has been compared with the semantic markers in LDOCE.electric current."TPC-W Query Execution
We scale TPC-W by first bulk loading 75 Emulated Browsers' worth of user data for each storage node in the cluster.We then run TPC-W and TPC-C queries on 2 primaries so that every global transaction will involve every primary.However     , their responsiveness remained intact and may even be faster.Methods which choose an SA-Intact grouping based on sensitive attributes alone are safe from the minimality attack.2 The ruletable size and BLEU score are shown in 
Comparison of Parameter Estimation
In this section we investigated the question of how many rules are shared by n-best and matrix-based extractions on small data FBIS corpus.To achieve this goal    , we surveyed the workload necessary to implement a novel annotator into GERBIL compared to the implementation into previous diverse frameworks.This is a rather surprising result given the wide usage of the LETOR datasets as it suggests that using the same judgment effort    , better collections could be created via other methods.  , web contents remain intact    , the integrity of the returned results typically refers to the following three properties e.g.Answers 1     , Quora 2 and WikiAnswer 3     , have emerged as extremely popular alternatives to acquire information online.Due to the immense annotation effort needed to judge the extracted events    , we evaluated one third of WikiWars and WikiWarsDE 7 documents of each corpus.The applications used for the evaluation are two services from Ask.com

The Allmusic Style Dataset attempts to more distinctively separate the collected data into different sub-genres    , alleviating predominating classes.Having targeted only users of GitHub    , this was a surprising result.GIT AND GITHUB 
This section provides a short introduction to Git and GitHub    , and introduces some of the terminology used in the remainder of this paper.More precisely    , the goal was to reproduce the GeneRIF Gene Reference into Function used in the LocusLink 1 database    , either from a Medline record or from the entire article.Furthermore    , we do not search for clones between the files of the EUSES corpus.For example    , in the graph below the FBIS-8665 is the document number    , therefore    , we can select the document FBIS3-8665 from the FBIS data set according to the DOCNO number.The WWW is an excellent means to gather data: Jester 1.0 was publicly announced on 02/12/98 and had 7136 users by 25/l 2/98.Dr. Javed Mostafa is currently the

WikiBios.TPC-W defines three workload mixes    , each with a different concentration of writes.More information about GERBIL and its source code can be found at the project's website.For each of these datasets    , we conduct 5-fold cross-validation experiments    , using the default partitions in LETOR.The comparative results are shown in 
Comparison with SemEval-2 Systems
 We compared our best results with the participating systems of the task.For the Xanga dataset    , the workload consists of a diverse set of queries of the above three types with a variety of constraints on structural properties and node attributes.Rather    , our goal is to utilize what LDOCE has to offer.We also plan to release the Quora dataset soon for the research community to facilitate further investigations.Co-occurrence data for the LDOCE controlled vocabulary has been collected.EXPERIMENT
Datasets
We evaluate our method on two standard large image datasets with semantic labels: CIFAR-10 
Experimental Settings and Baselines
 For both CIFAR-10 and NUS-WIDE datasets    , we randomly sample 1  ,000 points as query set    , 1  ,000 points as validation set    , and all the remaining points as training set.This is due to several reasons: GitHub encourages users to connect to projects and " follow " their development.The framework for constructing our semantic models is an ontology that makes a set of core distinctions between: a the gene/protein subsystem; b the organism; c the interactions of the gene/protein subsystem with the organism; and    , d the documents that report on the biological entities and processes.Because BLEU+1 boosts the precision component while leaving the BP intact    , the relative weight of BP decreases compared to the original BLEU.3 Public projects and profiles on GitHub have high exposure to many potential contributors and users.If the structure remains intact    , the change is quickly localized and the relatively expensive token alignment can be applied only to the affected subtree.More information can be found at our project webpage http:// gerbil.aksw.org and at the code repository page https: //github.com/AKSW/gerbil.by using distributed IR test collections where also the complete description is available    , or the samples obtained by considering the diverse query sets for sampling in the FedWeb test collections; – the use of diverse weighting scheme at document level    , e.g.Foundational Model of Anatomy ontology FMA 10 or Gene Ontology 11 that can be used to structure processes with semantic information.We find that all three of its internal graphs    , a user-topic follow graph    , a userto-user social graph    , and a related question graph    , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora.Experimental Data
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset
The FedWeb 2014 Dataset contains both result snippets and full documents sampled from 149 web search engines between April and May 2014.The naming regularities in LocusLink allowed us to design a simple set of rules and to extract 13  ,456 different genes grouped into 3  ,575 families/subfamilies/superfamilies.The general population of GitHub might have different characteristics and opinions.The patterns revealed by our visualization method remain intact    , and are simply shifted over to the area of the new key.We learned from the both EUSES case and the case studies that clones occur often in spreadsheets.Statistics of the two datasets are given in We crawled a complete set of reviews for BeerAdvocate and RateBeer all the way back to the inception of the site

Conclusions
The primary focus of this research proposal is to gain event understanding through employing automated tools and collecting diverse crowd semantic interpretations on different data modalities    , sources and event-related tasks.While Quora hosts a large number of topics    , and the set is still growing    , not all of these are equally popular in terms of follower count.For example    , in the article on Elvis Presley    , CoCit identified the link to the " AllMusic " category at the top rank.  , and 2 using the WikiTravel pages of the given locations i.e.And this is    , in essence    , the WePS Web People Search task we conducted at SemEval-2007 
The First Evaluation
The first evaluation was conducted in early 2007 and the results were reported at the SemEval-2007 workshop.JESTER the Java Environment for Statistical Transformations is a general workbench that allows the interactive selection of parameters for optimising the transfer relation between a pair of classification systems.We lower-case and tokenize by words    , but leave reviews intact    , rather than splitting them up into sentences.Nearly half of them were using GitHub for professional work 19; the other half 14 used GitHub for private projects.The corpus DUC2001 we used contains 147 news texts    , each of which has been labeled manually whether a sentence belongs to a summary or not.Genre classification was based on the " allmusic " website 
Analysis
 The data analysis consisted of three main stages: withinsubject consistency    , across-subject consistency    , and Multidimensional Scaling MDS.The default parameters for the Xanga dataset for the full list approach are set to k = m = 10 and those for the prefix list approach are set as k = 10    , m = 20    , which guarantees individual's privacy with probability at least 90%    , similar to previous work 
Experimental Results
Uniform List Anonymization.Currently    , GERBIL offers 9 entity annotation systems with a variety of features    , capabilities and experiments.To the best of our knowledge    , this work represents the most comprehensive study of topic growth dynamics and understanding of topic popularity in Quora.Secondly    , in the Douban friend community    , we obtain totally different trends.Data Source
 Our experiments are based on real data    , which are SNPs on chromosomes Y and 1 from dbSNP 
1 The UCSC reference genome HG18 1 .GERBIL aims to be a central repository for annotation results without being a central point of failure: While we make experiment URLs available    , we also provide users directly with their results to ensure that they use them locally without having to rely on GERBIL.For example    , Gene Ontology is a popular database that contains information about a gene product's cellular localization    , molecular function    , and biological process 
Such new standards    , vocabularies and common data elements are evolving for different biological data sets.That is    , the original file is left intact    , and a file of pointers is added.The guidelines provided to the annotators were based on the recent SemEval task on Cross-Level Semantic Similarity 
Automatic Creation of Cross-lingual Similarity Datasets
In this section we present our automatic method for building cross-lingual datasets.Over half of Xanga users list some URL under the Webpage category; however on closer examination the URLs listed we saw that a large number do not refer to personal webpages but rather to popular or favorite websites     , e.g.Data from the magnetic version of LDOCE is first loaded into a relational database system for simplicity of retrieving.It is crawled from the English part of Wikitravel.Simple K-nearest neighbour KNN with K set to 20 and Regression Tree was used to perform point-wise LETOR.This precisely interprets the effect of model-based adaptation: we only update the global model when it makes a mistake on the adaptation data; otherwise keep it intact.
