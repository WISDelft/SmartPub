In recent years, question answering (QA) has become a key research area in several of the world's major languages, possibly because of the urgent need to deal with the information overload caused by the rapid growth of the Internet. __label__=other
Since 1999, many international question answering contests have been held at conferences and workshops, such as TREC 1 , CLEF 2 , and NTCIR 3 . __label__=other
Thus far, several languages – such as Bulgarian, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, and Spanish – have been tested in monolingual or cross-lingual question answering tasks. __label__=other
In QA research, questions are usually classified into several categories, such as factoid questions, list questions, and definition questions, then dealt with by different techniques. __label__=other
Among these categories, factoid questions have been studied the most widely, and they are the focus of this paper. __label__=objective
There is usually exactly one answer, which is a noun or short phrase, for a factoid question. __label__=other
For example, " Who is the president of the United States? " __label__=other
is a factoid question because the name of the president is a noun, and there is only one current U.S. President. __label__=other
Factoid questions are usually classified into questions types, such as Q_PERSON, Q_LOCATION, Q_ORGANIZATION, Q_ARTIFACT, Q_TIME, and Q_NUMBER [Lee et al. __label__=other
2007; Lee et al. __label__=other
2005]. __label__=other
Although question types vary in different contests and different systems, the corresponding answer types can usually be recognized by named entity recognition (NER) techniques or simple rules. __label__=other
A QA system is normally comprised of several modules. __label__=other
The answer ranking module implements the last step in answering a factoid question and determines the final performance. __label__=other
After candidate answers have been extracted from retrieved passages, the answer ranking module takes the question, the passages (or documents), and the candidate answers as input, ranks the candidate answers, and then outputs a ranked list of candidate answers. __label__=other
Although several answer ranking methods have been proposed, they can be generally categorized as either deep or shallow methods. __label__=other
A deep method uses complex NLP techniques and may require extensive rules, ontologies, or human effort, while a shallow method does not require much of these resources and is therefore cheaper to implement. __label__=other
Although deep answer ranking methods have proven useful for English QA, as reported in [Cui et al. __label__=other
2005; Harabagiu et al. __label__=other
2005], the resources needed for such methods are usually Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering not available for some languages in monolingual or cross-lingual QA. __label__=other
In those cases, shallow ranking methods have to be used; however, to the best of our knowledge, very little research has been done on such methods. __label__=other
The situation is worse for cross-lingual tasks because most cross-lingual QA research has focused on the front-end modules, i.e., question processing and passage retrieval. __label__=other
Research on back-end modules, such as answer ranking, has received little attention in the cross-lingual QA domain. __label__=other
In this paper, we attempt to fill this research gap by exploring the behavior of shallow ranking features under noise produced by other QA modules in both monolingual and cross-lingual situations. __label__=objective
Herein, noise is defined in terms of the performance decrement of a QA module. __label__=other
For example, in the case of translation quality decrement, we say that we encounter translation noise and expect that the noise may impact the performance of some shallow ranking features. __label__=other
In addition to translation noise, we also consider passage retrieval noise and answer filter noise. __label__=other
We measure the influence of these types of noise by three performance metrics to determine which ranking feature is the most effective in dealing with each kind of noise. __label__=other
Apart from considering widely used shallow ranking features, we propose a new ranking feature called SCO-QAT, which has been successfully applied to the ASQA2 system [Lee et al. __label__=objective
2007], and also achieved the best performance on the C-C and E-C subtasks in NTCIR-6 CLQA [Sasaki et al. __label__=result
2007]. __label__=other
SCO-QAT is a co-occurrence based feature; however, unlike some co-occurrence features [Magnini et al. __label__=method
2001], it does not need extra knowledge, word-ignoring heuristic rules, or special tools. __label__=other
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. __label__=other
Related works are discussed in Section 2. __label__=other
We introduce the SCO-QAT feature in Section 3. __label__=other
The evaluation metrics used are introduced in Section 4. __label__=other
The ASQA2 system used in our experiments is described in Section 5. __label__=other
We detail our experiment results and compare SCO-QAT with other shallow features in Section 6. __label__=other
Then, we present our conclusions in Section 7.  __label__=other
Answer Ranking approaches can be divided in to deep and shallow methods. __label__=other
Deep approaches involve sophisticated tools or knowledge. __label__=other
The most advanced deep methods are logic-based and dependency-parser-based. __label__=other
The LCC team [Harabagiu et al. __label__=other
2005] used an abductive inference method to evaluate the correctness of an answer according to the logic form of the question, the logic form of the sentence that supports the answer, and background knowledge from WordNet. __label__=method
The logic-based approach has achieved the best QA performance in TREC for several years. __label__=other
Dependency-parser-based methods have also performed quite well on TREC tasks. __label__=other
The National University of Singapore team [Cui et al. __label__=other
2005] used dependency relations identified by a dependency parser to select answer nuggets for factoid and list questions. __label__=other
The similarity between the question and the supporting passage is calculated by machine translation models. __label__=other
Shen [Shen et al. __label__=other
2006] also used dependency relations, but incorporated them into a Maximum Entropy-based ranking model. __label__=other
Although these deep approaches perform well on monolingual QA (about 0.7 accuracy), they are quite demanding in terms of linguistic resources and computational complexity. __label__=other
In cross-lingual or multilingual QA, it is usually impossible to employ deep approaches for some languages due to the lack of knowledge resources or tools. __label__=other
In contrast, approaches with shallow features are much more flexible when QA languages are changed. __label__=result
The following are some commonly used shallow approaches. __label__=other
Surface patterns [Soubbotin and Soubbotin 2001] have been successful in the TREC QA Track, which uses string patterns to match questions with correct answers. __label__=method
However, from our perspective, if surface patterns are manually created, the method can not be regarded as " shallow " , because it is likely labor intensive. __label__=other
Although there are some " shallow " variations [Geleijnse and Korst 2006; Ravichandran and Hovy 2002] that attempt to create surface patterns automatically/semi-automatically, they usually suffer from the low coverage problem, which means they can only be applied to a few questions. __label__=other
Some approaches focus on local information, thus only take the similarity between a passage and the question into account when finding relevant answers. __label__=other
The simplest way to measure the similarity is by counting the ratio of question terms occurring in the answer passage, as has been reported [Cooper and Ruger 2000; Molla and Gardiner 2005; Zhao et al. __label__=other
2005]. __label__=other
Kwok [Kwok and Deng 2006] and AnswerBus [Zheng 2002] adopt the IR score of the answer passage directly as a measure of similarity. __label__=other
Intuitively, the closeness of two terms may indicate a relation; therefore, some systems [Gillard et al. __label__=other
2006; Sacaleanu and Neumann 2006; Tom´as et al. __label__=other
2005] use features based on the distance between the answer and the question terms to obtain a better similarity measurement. __label__=other
Among these approaches, those of Lin et al. __label__=other
and Roussinov et al. __label__=other
[Roussinov et al. __label__=other
2004] incorporate the IDF value with term distances. __label__=other
The assumption is that, if the candidate answer is close to several keywords or question terms, it is more likely to be relevant. __label__=other
Instead of utilizing local information, which only considers the question and a passage, redundancy-based features consider all the returned passages or the entire corpus. __label__=other
Clarke [Clarke et al. __label__=other
2001] suggested that redundancy could be used as a substitute for deep analysis because correct answers may appear many times in high-ranking passages. __label__=other
Features using frequency or co-occurrence information are all regarded as redundancy-based. __label__=other
Several systems [Clarke et al. __label__=other
2002; Cooper and Ruger 2000; Kwok and Deng 2006; Zhao et al. __label__=other
Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering 2005; Zheng 2002] include answer frequency in their Answer Ranking components. __label__=other
A web-based co-occurrence shallow feature developed by Magnini et al. __label__=other
[Magnini et al. __label__=other
2001] has been successfully applied on the TREC dataset. __label__=dataset
Magnini used three methods, Pointwise Mutual Information, Maximal Likelihood Ratio, and Corrected Conditional Probability, to measure the co-occurrence of each answer and the given question based on Web search results. __label__=method
However, to use Magnini's method, we also need some word-ignoring heuristic rules to remove search keywords when the number of returned web pages is insufficient.  __label__=other
Before comparing shallow ranking features, we define the SCO-QAT ranking feature that was applied successfully in the ASQA2 system at NTCIR-6. __label__=method
SCO-QAT relies on co-occurrence information about question terms and answer terms, and is therefore similar to Magnini's approach [Magnini et al. __label__=method
2001]. __label__=other
However, unlike Magnini's approach, which utilizes the Web as a corpus to help answer questions posed on a local corpus, SCO-QAT uses passages retrieved by the passage retrieval module from the local corpus directly and does not use any word-ignoring rules. __label__=other
The basic assumption of SCO-QAT is that, with good quality passages, the more often an answer co-occurs with question terms, the higher the probability that it is correct. __label__=other
Next, we describe the SCO-QAT function. __label__=other
Let the given answer be A and the given question be Q, where Q consists of a set, QT, of question terms {qt 1 , qt 2 , qt 3 , ……, qt n }. __label__=other
Based on QT, we define QC as a set of question term combinations, or more precisely {qc i | qc i is a subset of QT and qc i is not empty}. __label__=other
We also define a freq(X) function of a set X to indicate the number of retrieved passages in which all elements of X co-occur. __label__=other
The relation confidence is calculated as: ( , ) , if  <Equation_0> 0, if  <Equation_1>  <Equation_2> Then, the SCO-QAT formula is defined as: 1  <Equation_3> For example, given a question Q consisting of three question terms {qt1, qt2, qt3} and a corresponding answer set {c1, c2}, the retrieved passages are presented as follows: P1: qt1 qt2 c2 P2: qt1 qt2 qt3 c1 P3: qt1 qt2 c1 P4: qt1 c2 P5: qt2 c2 P6: qt1 qt3 c1 . __label__=other
We use Equation (2) to calculate the candidate answer's SCO-QAT score as follows: The rationale behind SCO-QAT is that we try to use retrieved passages as a resource to look up question terms and locate the correct answer. __label__=other
When a set of question terms QT co-occurs with an answer A, we can infer that some kind of relation exists between the QT set and the answer A, which could be helpful for identifying correct answers. __label__=other
However, as this kind of relation is not always correct, we have to find a way to deal with noisy relations. __label__=other
To this end, we use the confidence score shown in Equation (1) to measure the goodness of a rule, which is similar to the method used for finding association rules. __label__=method
Then, we take the sum of the confidence scores of all the co-occurrences of all question term combinations to resolve the noisy rule problem. __label__=method
This technique is useful if the returned passages contain a lot of redundant information about the given question and the answer.  __label__=other
In this section, we describe the evaluation metrics used in this paper. __label__=other
R-Accuracy and RU-Accuracy Two metrics, R-Accuracy and RU-Accuracy, are used to measure QA performance in NTCIR CLQA. __label__=method
A QA system returns a list of ranked answer responses for each question, but R-accuracy and RU-accuracy only consider the correctness of the top-1 ranked answer response on the list. __label__=other
An answer response is a pair comprised of an answer and its source document. __label__=other
Each answer response is judged as Right, Unsupported, or Wrong, as defined in the Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering NTCIR-6 CLQA overview [Lee et al. __label__=other
2007]Based on these criteria, the accuracy is calculated as the number of correctly answered questions divided by the total number of questions. __label__=method
R-accuracy means that only " Right " judgments are regarded as correct, while RU-accurakcy means that both " Right " and " Unsupported " judgments are counted. __label__=other
As R-accuracy only occurs a few times in this paper, we use " accuracy " to refer to RU-accuracy when the context is not ambiguous. __label__=other
the number of questions for which the top1 rank answer is Right number of questions R Accuracy − = the number of questions for which the top1 rank answer is Right or Unsupported number of questions RU Accuracy − = Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) We use MRR when we want to measure QA performance based on all the highest ranked correct answers, not only the top1 answer. __label__=method
MRR is calculated as follows: 1 , if a correct answer exists 1 the highest rank of correct answers number of questions 0, if no correct answer  <Equation_4> Expected Answer Accuracy (EAA) In addition to using the normal answer accuracy metrics, we propose a new metric called the Expected Answer Accuracy (EAA). __label__=other
We use EAA for cases where there are several top answers with the same ranking score. __label__=method
The EAA score of a ranking method is defined as follows: 1 number of correct answers with top1 rank score number of questions number of answers with top1 rank score  <Equation_5> Translation Cost We use the " translation cost " metric to measure the cost of introducing the cross-lingual function to a QA system. __label__=method
It is calculated as follows: accuracy of crosslingual QA -accuracy of monolingual QA accuracy of monolingual QA TranslationCost =  __label__=other
To evaluate answer ranking features, we chose the Academia Sinica Question Answering (ASQA) system as the testbed system for our experiment because it is modular and it performs well. __label__=software
Moreover, we can easily input different types of noise by adjusting the QA modules in ASQA. __label__=other
The system was developed by Academia Sinica 4 to deal with Chinese related QA tasks. __label__=other
The first version, ASQA1, can only deal with C-C QA, though. __label__=other
ASQA2, which is an extension of ASQA1, can deal with both C-C and E-C QA. __label__=software
We used ASQA1 in NTCIR-5 CLQA and ASQA2 in NTCIR-6 CLQA. __label__=software
NTCIR CLQA is the only QA contest in the world that focuses on Asian languages. __label__=other
On the C-C and E-C subtasks in NTCIR-6 CLQA, ASQA2 achieved the best performance with 0.553 and 0.34 RU-Accuracy, respectively. __label__=result
The system consists of several modules, as shown in Figure 1. __label__=other
In Question Processing, ASQA2 uses SVMs (Support Vector Machines) and syntax rules to identify the input question type and infer the expected answer types. __label__=method
The type taxonomy has 6 coarse-grained and 62 fined-grained answer types. __label__=other
For passage retrieval, we use Lucene 5 , an open source IR engine. __label__=software
The Chinese Answers with supporting documents Figure 1. __label__=other
System architecture of ASQA2 for Chinese-Chinese and English-Chinese Factoid QA English Question Processing EQC CQC CKeyword NER Normally, a cross-lingual QA system is constructed by modifying some components of a monolingual system; however, since translation is involved, the approach often results in performance deterioration. __label__=method
The degree of performance deterioration is usually used with the accuracy metric to evaluate the effectiveness of a cross-lingual system. __label__=other
We define the performance deterioration in terms of the translation cost, which is defined in Section 4. __label__=other
Figure 2shows the translation cost of systems in NTCIR-6 CLQA. __label__=other
When measuring the RU-Accuracy, the translation cost of ASQA2 ranks third, only slightly lower than the system in second place. __label__=other
Therefore, we consider that ASQA2 is an acceptable platform for our mono-lingual and cross-lingual experiments. __label__=software
Translation Cost on R-Acc Translation Cost on RU-Acc English Question Machine Figure 2. __label__=other
Translation costs of NTCIR-6 CLQA systems for factoid questions. __label__=other
The translation cost is calculated as the performance difference between cross-lingual and mono-lingual systems, divided by the mono-lingual performance. __label__=other
According to the ASQA2 working notes [Lee et al. __label__=other
2007], the system's success is attributable to three techniques: English question classification, answer template-based answer filtering, and answer ranking with the SCO-QAT feature. __label__=other
When the answer template-based answer filter is applied, it removes all the candidates except the one it deems correct. __label__=other
As it is impossible to compare ranking methods when there is only one answer, we removed the answer template-based filter so that it would not influence our analysis of the answer ranking features.  __label__=method
We conducted four experiments to explore the behavior of SCO-QAT and other shallow ranking features. __label__=method
In Experiment 1, we observed how shallow ranking features perform when a monolingual QA system is extended to a cross-lingual system. __label__=other
In Experiments 2, 3, and 4, we simulated situations where noise is introduced from the front-end modules and tried to determine which ranking feature is the most suitable under each kind of noise. __label__=method
Our testbed system is composed of several modules. __label__=other
Having described the system architecture in Section 5, we now elaborate on the dependencies between the experimental variables. __label__=other
First, we analyze the testbed system to identify several experimental variables and determine their interdependency, as shown in Figure 3. __label__=method
We are interested in the variables in bold font, as they will be used as independent or dependent variables in our experiments. __label__=other
The variables in gray font are not of interest because they are always controlled in the experiments. __label__=other
We provide details of the interdependency of the variables next. __label__=other
In this study, we focus on the Accuracy and other QA performance metrics; therefore, they are always dependent variables. __label__=objective
These performance metrics are directly influenced by three variables: the ranking feature, passage quality, and answer quality, since ranking features can use passages and answers. __label__=method
Furthermore, passage quality depends on the information retrieval model (IR model) used and the passage depth (the number of passages used for answer extraction). __label__=other
The greater the passage depth, the worse the passage quality is likely to be, which could result in more answers of progressively lower quality. __label__=result
When ASQA switches from a monolingual to cross-lingual task, two variables are triggered: translation and English question classification. __label__=other
When translation is active, a translation engine has to be chosen to translate the question. __label__=other
Bad translation quality has a chain reaction effect because it leads to bad query quality, which leads to bad passage quality and bad answer quality. __label__=other
In ASQA, answer extraction is based on named entity recognition (NER) and answer filtering is based on the compatibility of the question type and the answer type. __label__=method
Therefore, NER and question classification are two more variables that could influence answer quality. __label__=other
Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering Translation Engine Figure 3. __label__=other
Dependencies of experimental variables based on the architecture of ASQA 2. __label__=other
When a variable at the tail of an arrow changes, it would have influence on the variable at the arrow head. __label__=other
We experimented on several QA datasets. __label__=dataset
A QA dataset is comprised of a set of questions, their answers, and the document IDs of supporting documents. __label__=other
The answers and supporting documents are regarded as the gold standard. __label__=other
We used the following six datasets from NTCIR5 and NTCIR6 for the CLQA Chinese-Chinese (CC) and English-Chinese (EC) subtasks: NTCIR5-CC-D200, NTCIR5-CC-T200, NTCIR5-EC-D200, NTCIR5-EC-T200, NTCIR6-CC-T150, and NTCIR6-EC-T150. __label__=dataset
The last item of a dataset name indicates the number of questions and the dataset's purpose, where T stands for " test " and D stands for " development " . __label__=other
The CIRB40 corpus was used to compile the According to Lin , datasets created by QA evaluation forums are not suitable for post-hoc evaluation because the gold standard is not sufficiently comprehensive. __label__=dataset
This means we have to manually check all the extra answers not covered by the gold standard in order to derive more reliable experiment results. __label__=other
Since the number of questions in our experiments is quite large, it is not feasible for us to examine all the extra answers and their supporting documents. __label__=other
Therefore, we only use RU-accuracy to compare performances so that we do not have to check all the returned documents; only the answers are checked. __label__=method
These manually examined answers are then fed back to the datasets to form six expanded datasets: NTCIR5-CC-D200e, NTCIR5-CC-T200e, NTCIR5-EC-D200e, NTCIR5-EC-T200e, NTCIR6-CC-T150e, and NTCIR6-EC-T150e. __label__=dataset
In addition, we created the IASL-CC-Q465 dataset to increase the degree of confidence in our experiments. __label__=dataset
It was developed by three people using a program that randomly selected passages from the CIRB40 corpus, searched for relevant documents, and created questions from the collected documents. __label__=dataset
Finally, we had 1015 questions for the C-C task and 550 questions for the E-C task. __label__=method
Answer correctness features are usually combined in order to achieve the best performance. __label__=other
However, combining features in QA relies mostly on heuristic methods. __label__=other
Although some systems use machine learning approaches successfully for QA ranking, it is rare to see the same approach being applied to other QA work. __label__=other
This may be because QA feature combination methods are not mature enough to deal with the variability of QA systems, and the amount of Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering training data is not sufficient to train good models. __label__=other
Therefore, instead of combined features, we only studied the effect of single ranking features because we assume they are more reliable and can be easily applied to other systems or languages. __label__=method
Table 2shows the experimental set-up. __label__=other
Table 2. __label__=other
Experimental Set-up for Experiment 1 – Single Shallow Features Independent Variables Ranking Feature, Mono-or Cross-lingual Dependent Variables Accuracy, MRR, EAA Controlled Variables Passage Depth, Translation Engine, Answer Filter Along with SCO-QAT, we tested the following widely used shallow features: keyword overlap (KO), density, IR score (IR), mutual information score (MI), and answer frequency. __label__=method
The keyword overlap feature represents the ratio of question keywords found in a passage, as used in [Cooper and Ruger 2000; Molla and Gardiner 2005; Zhao et al. __label__=other
2005]. __label__=other
The IR score [Kwok and Deng 2006; Zheng 2002], which is provided by the passage retrieval module, is the score of the passage containing the answer. __label__=other
In ASQA2, the IR score is produced by the Lucene information retrieval engine 6 . __label__=software
Density is defined as the average distance between the answer and question keywords in a passage. __label__=other
There are several ways to calculate density. __label__=other
In this experiment, we simply adopt Lin's formula , which performed well in NTCIR-5 CLQA. __label__=method
The mutual information score is calculated by the PMI method used in [Magnini et al. __label__=method
2001], and instead of being based on the Web, it is calculated based on the whole corpus. __label__=other
The experiment results are listed in Table 3Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering In addition to comparing single ranking features, we compared the SCO-QAT results with those of other participants in the NTCIR5 CLQA task (Table 4). __label__=method
As the other QA systems used combined features, this is a single-versus combined-feature comparison. __label__=other
In the NTCIR5 CLQA task [Sasaki et al. __label__=other
2005], there were thirteen Chinese QA runs with an accuracy range of 0.105~0.445, and a mean of 0.315. __label__=result
It is impressive that ASQA2 with the single SCO-QAT feature achieved 0.515 accuracy 7 , which was much better than the accuracy of ASQA1 [Lee et al. __label__=result
2005], the best performing system in the NTCIR5 CLQA C-C subtask. __label__=other
Although SCO-QAT still performs well on the E-C datasets, its performance is not as good as on the C-C datasets. __label__=result
After analyzing the failed cases of E-C QA, we found the major problem was that some translations introduced words not listed in the stop word list. __label__=other
For example, there were some English questions in NTCIR CLQA, such as " Who is in charge of Indonesia's cabinet in 2000?＂After processing their Google translations, we identified improper keywords that were not on our stop word lists. __label__=other
For example, in the translation of the above question, " 由誰負責的印尼內閣於 2000 年?＂, we found " 由＂and " 於＂. __label__=other
Since SCO-QAT aggregates all co-occurrence scores, the effect of improper keywords is compounded. __label__=other
Although this problem could be solved by simply adding more stop words to the list, it should be noted that more new stop words may be introduced if the machine translation engine is changed. __label__=other
A better solution is to use the term-by-term translation approach because the stop word list can be controlled more easily. __label__=other
Although frequency is the simplest of the shallow features, it performs surprisingly well. __label__=other
It even achieves the best performance on one E-C dataset (NTCIR5-EC-D200). __label__=dataset
This may be due to the effectiveness of the ASQA2 answer filtering module, the characteristics of the Chinese news corpus, or the way questions were created, which caused questions with high frequency answers to be selected. __label__=other
We cannot find any papers on the effect of applying the frequency feature only. __label__=other
Further investigation is, therefore, needed to explain the phenomenon. __label__=other
The density feature measures the density of question terms around the answer based on the co-occurrence and distance information. __label__=other
Although it is widely used in QA systems, its performance is not as good as that of the IR score, which does not consider the distance information. __label__=other
This could be because the distance information is much noisier in QA that involves Chinese (e.g., E-C and C-C). __label__=other
We identified two types of errors caused by machine translations: wrong-term errors and synonym errors. __label__=result
Both types have a negative effect on the ranking features because the quality of the passages is often poor. __label__=result
The following is an example of a wrong term error. __label__=other
For the English question " Who is the director of the Chinese movie Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?＂, the word " director＂was translated by Google Translate to the wrong term " 新 任＂in " 誰是新任的中國電影臥虎藏龍?＂. __label__=other
Here, the semantics of " director＂and " 新 任＂are completely different. __label__=other
In cases like this, it is impossible to find good quality passages for ranking. __label__=other
Synonym errors occur when improper synonyms are introduced. __label__=other
For example, the English question " Who was Taiwan's Central Bank Governor with the longest tenure?＂is translated to " 誰是台灣的央行行長最長任期?＂by Google. __label__=other
Although " 行長＂is the correct translation for mainland China, it is not the normal way to describe the head of a bank in Taiwan; therefore, a query with " 行長 " can not retrieve appropriate passages from Taiwanese news corpora (e.g., CIRB40 and CIRB20). __label__=other
To develop a cross-lingual QA system, a monolingual system is usually created first and then some modules are adjusted to meet cross-lingual requirements. __label__=other
There are two widely used approaches: question translation and term-by-term translation. __label__=other
In the question translation approach, the question is translated into the target language by machine translation. __label__=other
The translated question is then input to the monolingual system. __label__=other
In the term-by-term approach, questions are analyzed in the source language and split into several important terms, which are then translated by using a bilingual dictionary or other techniques. __label__=other
Since ASQA2 adopts the question translation approach, we can control the translation quality intuitively using different machine translation engines. __label__=other
Noisy information introduced by a machine translation engine propagates down through the QA modules and results in wrong answers. __label__=other
We tested our system on two machine translation services (namely, Google Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering Translate and SYSTRAN 8 ) to determine how the translation quality affects the answer ranking features. __label__=software
Table 5shows the experimental set-up. __label__=other
Table 5. __label__=other
Experimental Set-up for Experiment 2 – Influence of Machine Translation Quality Independent Variables Ranking Feature, Translation Engine Dependent Variables Accuracy, MRR, EAA Controlled Variables Passage Depth, Mono-or Cross-lingual, Answer Filter We observe that Google's translation quality is better than that of SYSTRAN. __label__=result
In other words, the accuracy declines when Google Translate is replaced by SYSTRAN. __label__=result
The performance decrease ratio (calculated as the performance of using SYSTRAN divided by that of using Google) for each of the three E-C datasets is shown in Table 6. __label__=result
It seems to be difficult to predict the influence of the translation quality. __label__=result
If we only look at each dataset, the decrease ratio is quite unstable, ranging from 48.3% to 96.9% in terms of accuracy. __label__=result
However, when we consider the ratio based on all the datasets, it becomes more stable for all the ranking features. __label__=other
The standard deviation of the decrease in the accuracy ratio drops from more than 0.11 to 0.0655, which shows that the current datasets of NTCIR CLQA may be too small to be used with confidence in our experiments. __label__=result
Thus, it would be better to use all the EC datasets when comparing QA systems. __label__=dataset
For the EC-ALL dataset, SCO-QAT yields a better performance decrease ratio in terms of accuracy and EAA, but not in terms of MRR. __label__=result
The Frequency feature still performs relatively well, because the frequency of an answer is less dependant on the translation quality. __label__=other
Passage depth, defined as the number of passages used for answer extraction and answer ranking, plays a critical role in a QA system. __label__=other
On the one hand, by increasing the passage depth we can obtain more relevant passages and, therefore, have a better chance of improving QA performance. __label__=other
On the other hand, increasing the passage depth also introduces more irrelevant passages. __label__=other
If a ranking feature can not handle the noise caused by deep passages, it can not benefit from additional relevant passages. __label__=other
In this experiment, we increase the number of passages to evaluate the performance of shallow features when the number of irrelevant passages increases. __label__=other
The experimental setup is shown in Table 7. __label__=other
We observe the performance of all C-C and E-C datasets at five depth points between 100 and 500, as shown in Figure 4. __label__=other
We chose 100 as the starting depth because it is commonly adopted in QA systems as the document depth or passage depth. __label__=other
As expected, for both CC and EC situations, EAA declines when the passage depth increases. __label__=other
(The IR score ranking feature is an exception. __label__=other
It always remains the same because the passage IR score of an answer does not change when the passage depth increases). __label__=other
However, the decrease in EAA is not as high as we expected, which suggests that, with the exception of frequency and MI, shallow ranking features can handle deep passage noise. __label__=other
Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering Figure 4. __label__=other
Single feature accuracy over 5 passage depth points (100, 200, 300, 400, 500) for all C-C and E-C datasets. __label__=other
Among the ranking features, frequency and MI are influenced by passage depth the most. __label__=other
In EC, while frequency is the best at depth 100 in terms of EAA, the latter decreases rapidly when the passage depth increases to 200, which is much more unreliable than in the CC situation. __label__=other
In other words, the accuracy feature is much more unreliable in EC. __label__=result
For MI, it not only performed worse than the other features in terms of EAA, but also decreased substantially when the depth increased. __label__=result
This suggests that MI may not be suitable for retrieved passages, although it has been applied successfully when using the Web as a corpus. __label__=result
As answer ranking is directly influenced by the answer quality, it is important to evaluate the ranking feature on answers of different quality. __label__=other
In this experiment, we adjusted the answer quality by changing the answer filter. __label__=other
The experimental set-up is detailed in Table 8. __label__=other
Table 8. __label__=other
Experimental Set-Up for Experiment 4 – Influence of Answer Quality Independent Variables Ranking Feature, Mono-or Cross-lingual Dependent Variables Accuracy, MRR, EAA Controlled Variables Passage Depth, Translation Engine, Answer Filter The Expected Answer Type filter (EAT filter) is a submodule of ASQA2 that eliminates answers deemed incompatible with the question type. __label__=method
For example, if the question type is Q_LOCATION_COUNTRY, only answers representing countries will be retained. __label__=other
It is common for QA systems to use this kind of filtering mechanism, but they differ in the granularity of the answer type system they use. __label__=other
With a good EAT filter, the quality of the input for the subsequent Answer Ranking module will be less noisy and easier to deal with. __label__=other
By utilizing the ASQA2 answer-type system (i.e., 6 coarse-grained and 62 fine-grained types), we can experiment with answer ranking features on different granularities. __label__=other
We built three EAT filters, namely, a DoNothing Filter, a Coarse-grained Filter 9 , and a Fine-grained Filter. __label__=method
The DoNothing Filter does not filter out any answers; therefore, it may contain a lot of noisy information. __label__=other
The Coarse-grained Filter and Fine-grained Filter use coarse-grained and Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering fine-grained type information respectively. __label__=other
The Fine-grained Filter is used in the single feature experiment described in Section 6.3. __label__=other
Here, we conduct the same single feature experiment with the other two noisier EAT filters. __label__=other
The results are shown in Table 9. __label__=other
As expected, the performance of every feature deteriorates with the noisy EAT filters. __label__=result
In the CC datasets, with the Coarse-grained Filter, SCO-QAT's EAA declines from 0.514 to 0.499 on the CC-ALL dataset, but it is still better than the other features. __label__=result
Even with the noisiest DoNothing Filter, SCO-QAT can still maintain a 71% decrease ratio for the CC-ALL dataset, thereby demonstrating its robustness. __label__=result
The calculation of decrease ratios in this section is similar to that in the " Influence of Machine Translation Quality " section. __label__=other
When speaking of Coarse-grained Filter, it is calculated as the performance of using Coarse-grained Filter divided by the performance of using Fine-grained Filter. __label__=other
When speaking of DoNothing Filter, the formula is the same except that the numerator is replaced with the performance of using DoNothing Filter. __label__=other
Table 9also shows the performance decrease ratio caused by inefficient EAT filters. __label__=result
It is calculated by dividing the performance score of a noisy EAT filter by that of the standard Fine-grained Filter. __label__=other
From this perspective, SCO-QAT is still the best CC feature, achieving 97% and 71% EAA decrease ratio with the Coarse-Grained Filter and DoNothing EAT filter, respectively. __label__=result
The decline in some features is caused by too many answers being collocated in the same passage. __label__=other
Without a proper EAT filter, a passage could contain the correct answer and other answers; or, at worst, contain several answers, none of which are compatible with the given question. __label__=other
Table 9(a). __label__=other
Performance and decrease ratio in CC QA when the Coarse-grained EAT filter is replaced by Fine-grained and DoNothing EAT filters. __label__=result
Cross-Lingual and Monolingual Factoid Question Answering contain any answers related to the PERSON type. __label__=other
Without a proper filter, wrong answers in the top-ranked passages would be sent to the answer ranking module. __label__=other
As a result, the IR score would not help us differentiate between the correct answer and incorrect ones. __label__=other
Note that the decline in EC's performance is substantial when the DoNothing filter is applied. __label__=result
In the CC case, the decline in EAA for the SCO-QAT feature is 71%; however, in the EC case, it drops to 14%. __label__=result
This suggests that, in EC, information about the answer type is important, since it is more reliable than the shallow ranking features under noise introduced by translation. __label__=result

Performance and decrease ratio in EC QA when the Coarse-grained EAT filter is replaced by the Fine-grained and DoNothing EAT filters.  __label__=other
Sometimes, the resources needed to apply deep answer ranking approaches in a language are not available or the resource quality is not good enough. __label__=other
Hence, we conducted this research to help QA system designers choose shallow ranking features. __label__=objective
We experimented on six shallow ranking features (SCO-QAT, keyword overlap, density, IR score, mutual information score, and answer frequency) under various types of noise caused by different QA modules in mono-lingual and cross-lingual situations. __label__=method
We also proposed a novel answer ranking feature called SCO-QAT, which does not require extra knowledge or sophisticated tools. __label__=objective
It is, therefore, easy to implement in QA systems and may be used on various languages. __label__=other
In this pilot study, when the ASQA2 system only used the SCO-QAT ranking feature, it outperformed all the systems in NTCIR5 CLQA. __label__=result
For example, on the NTCIR5-CC-T200e QA dataset, we achieved 0.515 RU-Accuracy with the SCO-QAT feature only. __label__=result
Even the E-C version also achieved a 0.05 improvement over the best system. __label__=result
SCO-QAT also performed well in NTCIR6 CLQA, where the host system, ASQA2, achieved the best performance in the C-C subtask and the E-C subtask. __label__=result
To understand SCO-QAT better and to gain a deeper insight into shallow answer ranking features, we tested answer ranking features in various scenarios. __label__=other
We found that, although SCO-QAT performed very well in C-C QA, frequency seems the best choice for ranking in E-C QA in terms of EAA. __label__=result
However, the decrease in translation quality has a marked effect on the frequency of EAA, as shown by the fact that the EAA decrease ratio is 69.3%. __label__=result
In the same situation, SCO-QAT maintained a 74.2% EAA decrease ratio which was the best among the shallow ranking features. __label__=result
We also found that the noise introduced by passage depth does not impact much on ranking performance. __label__=other
This suggests that, if a long processing time is allowed, QA based on deep passages is a possible way to improve the performance when shallow features are used. __label__=result
In addition, answer-type-based filtering plays an important role, especially for E-C. __label__=result
When an extremely bad filter was used, the EAA decrease ratio in E-C for shallow ranking features was only 2%~21%, which shows a proper answer filter with fined-grained NER is critical to the success of an E-C system. __label__=result
In our future research on shallow ranking features, we will address the following issues. __label__=other
We will introduce a question term weighting scheme for SCO-QAT; use a taxonomy or ontology to alleviate the synonym problem that arises when counting co-occurrences of answers and question terms; experiment with shallow features on a Web corpus; utilize more syntactic information to make co-occurrence information more reliable; and test shallow features on other languages. __label__=objective
